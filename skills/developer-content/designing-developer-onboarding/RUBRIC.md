- First working example requires authentication setup >5 minutes
- Code examples have syntax errors or missing imports
- No expected output shown for commands
- "Getting started" leads to marketing page instead of docs
- Sandbox requires billing setup or approval
- Steps assume tools/accounts without listing as prerequisites
- Quickstart covers concepts instead of achieving a result
- Multi-language support shows empty or placeholder tabs
- Error handling not addressed until advanced sections
- No troubleshooting or "if something goes wrong" content
