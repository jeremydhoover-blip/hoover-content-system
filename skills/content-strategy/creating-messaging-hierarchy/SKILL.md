# Creating Messaging Hierarchy

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Product positioning and differentiation
- Target audience segments and their priorities
- Competitive landscape
- Key features and their benefits
- Business objectives for the messaging

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define the single core value proposition (10 words or less)
2. Create 3-4 supporting pillars that prove the value prop
3. For each pillar, develop proof points and feature-level messages
4. Map messages to audience segments (what resonates with whom)
5. Create message variations for different channels/contexts
6. Test against competitive messaging for differentiation
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
**Freedom level: Medium**
- Default: follow templates exactly
- Allowed variation: number of pillars (3-4), depth of feature messages, audience segment count—as long as rubric passes

## State awareness
- **New product launch**: Build full hierarchy from scratch; focus on differentiation
- **Feature release**: Fit new messaging into existing hierarchy; maintain consistency
- **Repositioning**: Audit existing messaging first; document what's changing and why
- **Competitive response**: Start from competitor analysis; find defensible gaps
