# Measuring Content Performance

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Content types to measure
- Business goals content supports
- Available data sources and tracking capabilities
- Stakeholder reporting needs
- Current measurement gaps

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Map content types to business outcomes
2. Define leading and lagging indicators for each content type
3. Identify data sources and tracking requirements
4. Set baselines and targets
5. Design reporting cadence and format
6. Create dashboard or report template
7. Document metric definitions for consistency
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
**Freedom level: Medium**
- Default: follow templates exactly
- Allowed variation: specific metrics per content type, reporting frequency, visualization style—as long as rubric passes

## State awareness
- **No measurement**: Start with basics; focus on 3-5 key metrics
- **Basic measurement**: Add leading indicators; connect to business outcomes
- **Mature measurement**: Optimize for causation; A/B test content changes
- **Data-constrained**: Work with available data; document what you can't measure
