## Example 3: Edge case — Resource-constrained team

**Input:**

- Challenge: Can't do everything; ruthless prioritization needed

**Output:**

```md
# Content Roadmap: MVP Documentation

## Planning period
**Timeframe:** 6 weeks (Sprint-based)
**Capacity:** 20 hours/week = 120 total hours
**Owner:** Solo content person

---

## Prioritization: What ships vs. what waits

### Must ship (80 hours allocated)
| Item | Hours | Rationale |
|------|-------|-----------|
| Getting started guide | 15 | #1 user need—can't launch without |
| Core feature docs (3) | 30 | Covers 80% of use cases |
| Error message reference | 10 | Reduces support load |
| FAQ (top 10 questions) | 10 | Predicted from beta feedback |
| Quick reference card | 5 | High-value, low-effort |
| Basic troubleshooting | 10 | Self-service essential |

### Nice to have (20 hours buffer)
| Item | Hours | Ship if time permits |
|------|-------|---------------------|
| Advanced feature docs | 15 | Only if core docs done early |
| Video walkthrough | 5 | Script only, record post-launch |

### Post-launch backlog
- API documentation
- Integration guides  
- Advanced troubleshooting
- Localization

---

## Weekly plan

| Week | Focus | Deliverable |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Foundation | Getting started guide |
| 2 | Core features | Feature doc 1 + 2 |
| 3 | Core features | Feature doc 3 |
| 4 | Support content | Error reference + FAQ |
| 5 | Support content | Troubleshooting + quick ref |
| 6 | Buffer | Polish, fixes, nice-to-haves |

---

## Quality tradeoffs (documented)

To ship on time with limited resources:
- ✓ Accuracy: Non-negotiable
- ✓ Completeness for core flows: Non-negotiable
- ~ Depth: Good enough, not comprehensive
- ~ Polish: Clean but not perfect
- ✗ Advanced content: Deferred to post-launch

---

## Success criteria
- [ ] User can complete core tasks using docs alone
- [ ] Zero critical accuracy errors
- [ ] Support team has reference material
- [ ] Backlog is documented for post-launch
```
