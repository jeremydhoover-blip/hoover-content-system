# Planning Content Roadmaps

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Business objectives and timelines
- User needs and content gaps
- Resource constraints (team size, budget)
- Dependencies (product launches, campaigns, seasonal events)
- Current content performance data

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define planning horizon (quarterly recommended for most teams)
2. Inventory current content and identify gaps against user journeys
3. Gather business priorities and fixed dates (launches, campaigns)
4. Score and prioritize content items (impact vs. effort)
5. Sequence based on dependencies and resource availability
6. Build timeline with clear milestones
7. Define success metrics for each content initiative
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
**Freedom level: Medium**
- Default: follow templates exactly
- Allowed variation: planning horizon length, prioritization framework, level of detail per initiative—as long as rubric passes

## State awareness
- **New team/product**: Start with foundational content; prioritize highest-impact gaps
- **Established operation**: Balance maintenance, optimization, and new content
- **Resource-constrained**: Ruthlessly prioritize; cut scope before quality
- **Fast-moving company**: Shorter planning cycles; more buffer for reactive work
