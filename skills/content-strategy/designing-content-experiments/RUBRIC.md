## Pass criteria
Pass if all are true:

- [ ] Hypothesis is falsifiable (can be proven wrong)
- [ ] Primary metric is clearly defined with baseline
- [ ] Minimum detectable effect is specified
- [ ] Sample size calculation is included
- [ ] Duration estimate is based on traffic and sample size
- [ ] Control and variant(s) are documented with specific differences
- [ ] Guardrail metrics are defined
- [ ] Stopping criteria are explicit
- [ ] Decision framework covers all outcomes (win, lose, inconclusive)
- [ ] Traffic allocation and targeting are documented

## Fail criteria
Fail if any are true:

- [ ] Hypothesis is vague or unfalsifiable
- [ ] No sample size calculation
- [ ] Missing baseline metric
- [ ] No stopping criteria (open-ended experiment)
- [ ] Decision framework missing or incomplete
- [ ] Testing multiple variables without multivariate design
- [ ] No guardrail metrics
- [ ] Peeking encouraged (checking results before sample size reached)
- [ ] Variant description is unclear or undocumented
