# Creating Content Briefs

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Content objective and success metrics
- Target audience and their needs
- Key messages and required information
- Tone and style requirements
- Technical constraints and dependencies
- Review process and stakeholders

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define the content objective and why it matters
2. Identify target audience with specific needs/context
3. Outline required content elements and key messages
4. Specify tone, voice, and style requirements
5. Document constraints (length, format, timeline)
6. List dependencies and reference materials
7. Define success metrics and review criteria
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
**Freedom level: Medium**
- Default: follow templates exactly
- Allowed variation: level of detail per section, additional context sections—as long as rubric passes

## State awareness
- **Internal writer**: Can assume context; focus on specifics and differentiation
- **External writer/agency**: More background needed; be explicit about everything
- **Urgent timeline**: Prioritize must-haves; mark nice-to-haves clearly
- **Complex stakeholder environment**: Include approval chain and feedback process
