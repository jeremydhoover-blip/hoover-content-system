## Pass criteria
Pass if all are true:

- [ ] Contains 3-5 voice principles, each with a clear "this, not that" contrast
- [ ] Each principle includes at least one concrete do/don't example
- [ ] Tone spectrum covers minimum 4 emotional contexts (positive → neutral → warning → critical)
- [ ] Tone modulation rules specify when and how to shift tone
- [ ] Examples use realistic product scenarios, not generic placeholder text
- [ ] Voice principles are specific enough to differentiate from competitors
- [ ] Guidelines are actionable without requiring interpretation
- [ ] No contradictions between principles
- [ ] Covers both UI copy and longer-form content where applicable
- [ ] Includes quick reference format for scanning

## Fail criteria
Fail if any are true:

- [ ] Voice principles are vague adjectives without behavioral definition ("be friendly")
- [ ] Missing tone spectrum or only covers positive scenarios
- [ ] Examples are generic or could apply to any brand
- [ ] Contradictory guidance (e.g., "be concise" but examples are verbose)
- [ ] No "not this" contrasts provided
- [ ] Tone modulation rules missing or only say "use judgment"
- [ ] Principles duplicate shared guidance without adding specificity
- [ ] Guidelines require external context to understand
