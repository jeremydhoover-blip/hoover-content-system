# Tone Spectrum Reference

## Core concept

Voice is constant; tone modulates. Voice is *who* you are; tone is *how* you adapt to the moment.

```
Voice = Personality (stable)
Tone = Mood adjustment (contextual)
```

## Standard tone spectrum

Map content contexts to a tone range. Most products need at least these five zones:

| Zone | Emotional context | Characteristics |
|------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Celebratory** | Success, milestones, achievements | Warm, enthusiastic (calibrated to brand), brief |
| **Neutral** | Informational, transactional, settings | Clear, direct, personality-light |
| **Guidance** | Instructions, education, help | Patient, supportive, specific |
| **Warning** | Caution, potential consequences | Direct, specific, action-oriented |
| **Critical** | Errors, failures, crises | Calm, precise, solution-focused |

---

## Tone modulation factors

### 1. User emotional state
| User is likely feeling | Tone should be |
|------------------------|----------------|
| Excited, accomplished | Match energy briefly, then return to neutral |
| Confused, stuck | Patient, step-by-step, no blame |
| Frustrated, angry | Calm, acknowledge, focus on resolution |
| Anxious, uncertain | Reassuring, clear, no ambiguity |
| Rushed, impatient | Concise, scannable, action-first |

### 2. Task stakes
| Stakes | Tone adjustment |
|--------|-----------------|
| Low (browsing, exploring) | Can be lighter, more personality |
| Medium (configuration, decisions) | Balanced, clear, some warmth |
| High (payment, deletion, legal) | Serious, precise, no ambiguity |
| Critical (data loss, security) | Urgent, calm, action-focused |

### 3. User expertise
| Expertise level | Tone adjustment |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Beginner | More explanation, encouraging, patient |
| Intermediate | Balanced, efficient, some shorthand okay |
| Expert | Direct, minimal explanation, respect competence |

## Anti-patterns

### Tone mismatch examples

| Context | Wrong tone | Why it fails |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| Payment failed | "Oopsie! Your card didn't work 😅" | Trivializes financial stress |
| Delete account | "Are you SURE? We'll miss you! 💔" | Manipulative, guilt-inducing |
| Security alert | "Hey, just a heads up..." | Undersells urgency |
| First success | "Task complete." | Misses moment to build connection |
| Complex error | "Something went wrong!" | Not actionable |

### Tone inconsistency

Avoid jarring shifts within a single flow:
- Don't go from playful onboarding → robotic settings → playful dashboard
- Maintain consistent baseline with contextual modulation

## Tone documentation checklist

When documenting tone for a product:

- [ ] Defined at least 4 tone zones with examples
- [ ] Specified modulation triggers (when to shift)
- [ ] Provided contrast examples (this/not this)
- [ ] Covered high-stakes scenarios explicitly
- [ ] Addressed how tone adapts across user expertise levels
- [ ] Identified brand-specific tone boundaries (what you never sound like)
