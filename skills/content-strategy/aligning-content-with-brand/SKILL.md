# Aligning Content with Brand

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Brand positioning and strategy documents
- Existing voice and tone guidelines
- Content samples to evaluate
- Brand attributes and personality traits
- Key differentiators from competitors

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Extract core brand attributes from brand strategy
2. Translate brand attributes into content behaviors
3. Create brand-content alignment matrix
4. Develop do/don't examples for each attribute
5. Define alignment check process
6. Create scoring rubric for brand alignment audits
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
**Freedom level: Low**
- Default: follow templates exactly
- Allowed variation: number of brand attributes mapped, specificity of examples—as long as rubric passes
- Strict constraints: Must map directly from brand strategy; cannot invent new brand positioning

## State awareness
- **New brand**: Work closely with brand team; establish content-brand bridge early
- **Established brand**: Audit current content against brand; identify gaps
- **Rebrand**: Document changes explicitly; create transition guidance
- **Multi-brand portfolio**: Separate alignment guides per brand; document shared elements
