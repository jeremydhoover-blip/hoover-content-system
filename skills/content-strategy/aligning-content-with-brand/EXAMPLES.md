## Brand-to-content translation

| Brand attribute | What it means (brand) | What it means (content) | Content example |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Powerful | Enterprise capabilities | Show capability without overwhelming | "Handle millions of records" not "robust scalable infrastructure" |
| Simple | Easy to use | Clear, jargon-free, scannable | "Set up in 3 clicks" not "streamlined configuration process" |
| Fast | Quick implementation | Emphasize speed, reduce friction | "Live in hours" not "rapid deployment capabilities" |
| Trustworthy | Reliable, secure | Specific claims, show evidence | "99.9% uptime" not "industry-leading reliability" |

---

## Content behaviors in detail

### Powerful: Show, don't tell

**Brand says:** Enterprise-grade capabilities
**Content does:** Demonstrates capability with specifics, not adjectives

**This looks like:**
- Concrete numbers ("10 million rows," "500 integrations")
- Feature comparisons that show capability
- Customer proof points at scale

**This doesn't look like:**
- Vague power words ("robust," "powerful," "comprehensive")
- Enterprise jargon ("leverage," "optimize," "utilize")
- Claims without evidence

**Example:**
> ✓ "Process 10 million records in under a minute"
> ✗ "Robust and scalable data processing capabilities"

---

### Simple: Clarity over cleverness

**Brand says:** Startup-speed simplicity
**Content does:** Uses plain language, reduces cognitive load

**This looks like:**
- Short sentences (under 20 words)
- Common words over technical terms
- One idea per paragraph
- Visual hierarchy for scanning

**This doesn't look like:**
- Dense paragraphs
- Jargon without explanation
- Clever wordplay that obscures meaning

**Example:**
> ✓ "Connect your data in 3 steps"
> ✗ "Our intuitive onboarding experience facilitates seamless data integration"

---

### Fast: Emphasize speed

**Brand says:** Quick time to value
**Content does:** Highlights speed, reduces perceived effort

**This looks like:**
- Time estimates ("5 minutes," "same day")
- Step counts ("3 steps")
- "Start now" language

**This doesn't look like:**
- Open-ended timelines
- Complex prerequisite lists
- Process-heavy language

**Example:**
> ✓ "Go live today. Most teams are up in 2 hours."
> ✗ "Begin your digital transformation journey with our onboarding program"

---

### Trustworthy: Prove it

**Brand says:** Reliable and secure
**Content does:** Provides evidence, avoids empty claims

**This looks like:**
- Specific numbers (uptime %, certifications)
- Named customers with permission
- Transparent about limitations

**This doesn't look like:**
- Vague superlatives ("best-in-class," "industry-leading")
- Unsubstantiated claims
- Hiding limitations

**Example:**
> ✓ "99.9% uptime SLA. SOC 2 Type II certified."
> ✗ "Industry-leading security and reliability"

---

## Content type alignment

| Content type | Primary attribute | Secondary | Special considerations |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|----------------------|
| Marketing | Simple, Fast | Powerful | Lead with ease, prove with capability |
| Product UI | Simple | Fast | Never sacrifice clarity for brevity |
| Documentation | Trustworthy | Simple | Accuracy first, then clarity |
| Sales | Powerful | Trustworthy | Match to buyer sophistication |

---

## Red flags
- "Leverage," "utilize," "optimize" (jargon alert)
- "Best-in-class," "industry-leading" (empty claims)
- Paragraphs over 3 sentences (complexity creep)
- No numbers in capability claims (missing evidence)
```

---

## Example 2: Consumer brand alignment

**Input:**
- Brand positioning: "Wellness that fits your life"
- Brand attributes: Encouraging, Realistic, Personal, Science-backed
- Target audience: Busy adults who've failed at wellness before
- Challenge: Be supportive without being preachy

**Output:**

# Brand-Content Alignment Guide: BalanceWell

## Brand foundation

### Brand positioning
BalanceWell is wellness that adapts to your life—not the other way around. We meet you where you are with science-backed tools and judgment-free support.

### Brand promise
Progress, not perfection.

### Key differentiators
1. Personalized recommendations based on your actual life
2. Evidence-based approach without the lecture
3. Celebrates small wins, doesn't shame setbacks

---

## Brand-to-content translation

| Brand attribute | What it means (brand) | What it means (content) | Content example |
|-----------------|----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| Encouraging | Supportive, positive | Celebrate effort, acknowledge difficulty | "You showed up—that's the hard part" |
| Realistic | Honest, no false promises | Acknowledge constraints, offer alternatives | "Short on time? Try our 5-minute option" |
| Personal | Adapted to individual | Use "you" language, acknowledge variety | "Your version of healthy" |
| Science-backed | Evidence-based | Cite research, avoid pseudoscience | "Studies show..." with source |

---

## Content behaviors in detail

### Encouraging: Support without performing

**Brand says:** Judgment-free support
**Content does:** Acknowledges effort, doesn't oversell enthusiasm

**This looks like:**
- Understated celebration ("Nice work." not "AMAZING!!!")
- Acknowledging that things are hard
- Forward-looking after setbacks

**This doesn't look like:**
- Cheerleader energy (excessive enthusiasm)
- Toxic positivity (ignoring real struggles)
- Guilt or shame

**Example:**
> ✓ "Missed a few days? That's okay. Pick up where you left off."
> ✗ "Don't give up! You've got this! Every day is a new chance! 💪✨"

---

### Realistic: Honor constraints

**Brand says:** Fits your life
**Content does:** Acknowledges real-world limitations

**This looks like:**
- Options for different time/energy levels
- Acknowledging that life gets in the way
- Not requiring perfection

**This doesn't look like:**
- One-size-fits-all prescriptions
- Implying failure if you can't do the full program
- Ignoring common obstacles

**Example:**
> ✓ "Don't have 30 minutes? Here's a 5-minute version that still counts."
> ✗ "Commit to 30 minutes daily for best results."

---

### Personal: It's about them

**Brand says:** Adapted to the individual
**Content does:** Uses personal language, avoids universal prescriptions

**This looks like:**
- "You" and "your" language
- Acknowledging different bodies/needs
- Choices over mandates

**This doesn't look like:**
- "Everyone should..."
- One body type in examples
- Prescriptive language

**Example:**
> ✓ "Find what works for your body"
> ✗ "The best morning routine for everyone"

---

### Science-backed: Evidence, not lectures

**Brand says:** Based on research
**Content does:** Cites evidence without being preachy

**This looks like:**
- Brief research mentions with sources available
- "Research suggests" not "You must"
- Explaining why something works

**This doesn't look like:**
- Dense citations that feel academic
- Lecturing or moralizing
- Pseudoscience or unfounded claims

**Example:**
> ✓ "Taking a 10-minute walk after meals can help stabilize blood sugar (research shows a 22% improvement)."
> ✗ "Studies definitively prove you should walk after every meal for optimal metabolic function."

---

## Red flags
- Exclamation points (more than 1 per screen = too enthusiastic)
- "You should" / "You need to" (prescriptive)
- Weight loss promises (not our positioning)
- Comparison to others ("Unlike other people who...")
```

---

## Example 3: Edge case — Evolving brand

**Input:**
- Situation: Brand is shifting from "playful and fun" to "playful and trusted"
- Challenge: Add trust signals without losing personality
- Constraint: Can't alienate existing customers who love the playful tone

**Output:**

```md
# Brand-Content Alignment Guide: FunBank (Transition)

## Brand evolution

### Previous positioning
"Banking that doesn't take itself too seriously"

### New positioning  
"Banking that's easy to trust and easy to use"

### What's staying
- Playful tone
- Visual personality
- Approachable language

### What's changing
- Adding trust signals
- More substance behind the fun
- Serious when stakes are high

---

## Transition guidance

### The shift
FROM: Fun for fun's sake
TO: Fun with a foundation

### How this looks in content

| Situation | Old approach | New approach |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Feature announcement | "🎉 New thing! It's awesome!" | "New: Instant transfers, now with bank-level encryption. 🎉" |
| Error message | "Oops! Something went wrong 😅" | "Transfer didn't go through. Here's why + how to fix it." |
| Security feature | (didn't emphasize) | "Your money is protected by [specific measures]" |

---

## When to be playful vs. serious

### Stay playful
- Onboarding and welcome
- Success moments
- Marketing and social
- Non-critical UI

### Shift to serious (with warmth)
- Security information
- Error states
- Money movement
- Legal and compliance

### Example: Tone shift within a flow

**Playful (start):**
> "Let's set up your account! 🏦"

**Neutral (middle):**
> "We need to verify your identity. This protects your money."

**Serious (money moment):**
> "You're about to transfer $500 to [Name]. This can't be undone."

**Playful (success):**
> "Done! Your money's on its way. ✓"

---

## Red flags during transition
- Playful language around security ("Don't worry, we've got Fort Knox vibes!")
- Serious language everywhere (losing personality)
- Inconsistent within single flow
- Empty trust claims without specifics
```
