# Structuring Documentation Information Architecture

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- User roles and their primary tasks
- Content inventory (existing or planned)
- Product complexity and scope
- Navigation patterns of similar products
- Search vs browse usage patterns

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify distinct user personas and their top tasks.
2. Group content by user intent (getting started, learning, reference, troubleshooting).
3. Design primary navigation structure (max 7±2 top-level items).
4. Create hierarchy within each section (max 3 levels deep).
5. Define cross-linking strategy for related content.
6. Plan landing pages for each major section.
7. Validate with card sorting or user testing.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium**: Organizational model can vary based on product type.
- Allowed variation: Number of top-level sections, naming conventions, and depth can vary as long as rubric passes.

## State awareness
- If product has multiple user roles, consider role-based navigation.
- If content spans multiple products, use consistent cross-product patterns.
- If documentation is versioned, integrate version selector.
- If content is extensive, prioritize search over deep navigation.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Organizing by internal team structure instead of user needs
- Creating navigation deeper than 3 levels
- Using internal jargon in navigation labels
- Missing landing pages for major sections
- No clear path from entry to common tasks
