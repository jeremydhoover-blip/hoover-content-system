# Rubric

Pass if all are true:

- [ ] Documentation source files are version controlled
- [ ] Automated linting configured and runs on PRs
- [ ] Broken link checking automated
- [ ] Build process automated and documented
- [ ] Build failures block PR merge
- [ ] Contribution guide exists and explains workflow
- [ ] PR template includes relevant checklist
- [ ] Preview environment available for review
- [ ] Deployment automated from main branch
- [ ] File naming and organization conventions documented

Fail if any are true:

- No automated validation in CI
- Build failures do not block merge
- No contribution documentation
- No preview capability for reviewers
- Manual deployment required
- Inconsistent file naming without documented convention
- No spell checking or link validation
- Documentation changes require different workflow than code
