# Rubric

Pass if all are true:

- [ ] Problem is described with specific, observable symptoms
- [ ] Symptoms are described from user perspective (what they see/experience)
- [ ] Multiple potential causes are listed when applicable
- [ ] Causes are ordered by likelihood (most common first)
- [ ] Each cause has diagnostic criteria to identify it
- [ ] Each cause has specific resolution steps
- [ ] Each resolution includes verification step
- [ ] Escalation path provided for unresolved issues
- [ ] Diagnostic commands include expected outputs
- [ ] No resolution assumes cause without diagnostic step

Fail if any are true:

- Symptoms describe internal system state rather than user-observable behavior
- Causes listed without way to differentiate between them
- Resolution steps provided without verifying the problem is fixed
- Escalation path missing
- Single cause assumed without diagnostic confirmation
- Prevention advice mixed with troubleshooting (belongs in separate doc)
- Resolution requires permissions not stated in prerequisites
- Error messages quoted incompletely or inaccurately
