# Mapping Content to User Journeys

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Feature or product scope
- Target user segment(s)
- Journey stages relevant to this feature
- Known touchpoints (screens, notifications, emails, etc.)
- Success metrics per stage

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define journey scope: full lifecycle or specific phase.
2. Identify journey stages using the [journey stage taxonomy](reference/journey-stage-taxonomy.md).
3. List all content touchpoints per stage.
4. Classify touchpoint types using the [touchpoint classification](reference/touchpoint-classification.md).
5. Map user goals and emotional state per stage.
6. Identify content gaps (stages with missing or weak content).
7. Document content dependencies and handoffs between stages.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Default:** Medium. Journey structures follow standard patterns but can adapt to product context.
- **Allowed variation:** Stage naming, granularity of touchpoint mapping, and visual format may vary. Core structure and gap analysis must remain.

## Failure modes to avoid
- Mapping only happy path without considering recovery journeys
- Ignoring emotional context at each stage
- Missing cross-channel touchpoints (email, push, in-app)
- Treating journey as linear when it has branches or loops
- Conflating content goals with business goals without reconciliation
