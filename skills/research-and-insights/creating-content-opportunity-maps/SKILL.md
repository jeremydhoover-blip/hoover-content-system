# Creating Content Opportunity Maps

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- User needs or pain points (from research, feedback, support data)
- Current content inventory (what exists)
- Business priorities (growth levers, strategic goals)
- Evaluation dimensions (axes for mapping)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. List content opportunities (gaps, improvements, new content ideas)
2. Define mapping dimensions based on decision criteria
3. Score each opportunity on both dimensions
4. Plot opportunities on the map
5. Identify clusters and quadrants
6. Write prioritization recommendations with rationale
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Opportunities must be tied to evidence (research, data, feedback)
- **Medium**: Dimension selection based on decision context
- **High**: Visual format, granularity of opportunities

## State awareness
- If many opportunities: use higher-level groupings, then detail top quadrant
- If unclear priorities: propose multiple dimension pairs for stakeholder discussion
- If limited resources: weight toward effort axis to surface quick wins
- If strategic planning: weight toward impact axis to surface big bets

## Failure modes to avoid
- Mapping without evidence (opinions presented as opportunities)
- Using dimensions that don't differentiate (everything scores "high")
- Overloading with too many opportunities (>20 on one map)
- Missing the "so what" (map without prioritization recommendation)
- Conflating effort to create with effort to maintain
