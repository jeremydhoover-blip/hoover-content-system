# Mapping Qualitative to Quantitative

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Qualitative findings (themes, patterns, quotes from research)
- Business context (what decisions need data support)
- Available measurement channels (analytics, surveys, support tickets)
- Confidence threshold needed (directional vs. statistically significant)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Review qualitative themes and extract observable behaviors or attitudes
2. For each theme, identify what "more" or "less" would look like
3. Map each theme to measurable constructs (behavior, perception, outcome)
4. Select measurement method appropriate to construct type
5. Define specific metrics with collection approach
6. Document assumptions and validation requirements
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Metric must trace back to qualitative finding
- **Medium**: Choice of measurement method for each construct
- **High**: Threshold definitions and sample size decisions

## State awareness
- If qualitative finding is behavioral: prioritize analytics/observation metrics
- If qualitative finding is attitudinal: prioritize survey/rating metrics
- If qualitative finding is contextual: prioritize segmentation dimensions
- If validation urgency is high: start with existing data before new collection

## Failure modes to avoid
- Creating metrics that don't actually measure the qualitative insight
- Losing nuance by oversimplifying complex themes
- Assuming correlation means the metric captures the insight
- Defining unmeasurable or impractical metrics
- Skipping the "what would change our decision" question
