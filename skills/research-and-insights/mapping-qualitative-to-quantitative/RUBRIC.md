# Rubric

## Pass criteria
All must be true:

- [ ] Every quantitative metric traces to a specific qualitative theme
- [ ] Observable signal is defined (what behavior/attitude indicates the theme)
- [ ] Metric type matches the construct (behavioral → analytics, attitudinal → survey)
- [ ] Metric definition is precise enough for consistent measurement
- [ ] Collection method is specified and feasible
- [ ] Assumptions are documented with risks
- [ ] Limitations of each metric are acknowledged
- [ ] At least one metric per major qualitative theme
- [ ] Metrics are actionable (results would change decisions)

## Fail criteria
Fail if any are true:

- [ ] Metric has no traceable link to qualitative finding
- [ ] Metric definition is ambiguous ("user engagement" without formula)
- [ ] Collection method doesn't exist or isn't accessible
- [ ] Metric requires sample size that's infeasible
- [ ] Survey questions are leading or double-barreled
- [ ] Observable signal is actually an inference, not observable
- [ ] All metrics are lagging (no leading indicators)
- [ ] Metrics could be gamed without real improvement

## Quality checks by construct type

### Behavioral metrics
- [ ] Can be measured through existing instrumentation or observation
- [ ] Frequency, duration, or count is specified
- [ ] Segmentation approach is defined

### Attitudinal metrics
- [ ] Question wording avoids leading language
- [ ] Response scale is appropriate (5-point, 7-point, etc.)
- [ ] Face validity is addressed (does it measure what it claims?)

### Outcome metrics
- [ ] Success/failure criteria are explicit
- [ ] Timeframe is specified
- [ ] Attribution limitations are acknowledged
