# Synthesizing User Research

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Research method(s) used (interviews, usability tests, surveys, etc.)
- Number of participants and segment distribution
- Research questions or objectives
- Raw data sources (transcripts, notes, recordings, survey responses)
- Intended audience for synthesis (product, design, leadership)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Review research objectives — what questions were we trying to answer?
2. Organize raw data by participant, then by theme or topic.
3. Identify patterns: behaviors, pain points, mental models, quotes.
4. Cluster similar observations into themes.
5. Distinguish between observations (what happened) and insights (what it means).
6. Quantify where possible: "7 of 10 participants..." not "many participants..."
7. Prioritize findings by frequency, severity, and alignment with research goals.
8. Generate actionable recommendations tied to specific insights.
9. Document methodology and limitations.
10. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Faithful representation of participant statements, methodology accuracy
- **Medium freedom**: Theme naming, insight framing, recommendation specificity
- **High freedom**: Narrative structure, prioritization framework, visualization choices

Default: Prioritize accuracy over elegance. Quote participants directly when possible. Flag inferences clearly.
