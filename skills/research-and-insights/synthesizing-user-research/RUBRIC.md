Pass if all are true:
- Executive summary captures key findings without requiring full read
- Methodology section documents method, participants, recruitment, and limitations
- Findings are grounded in specific observations, not assumed
- Participant counts provided: "7 of 10" not "most" or "many"
- Direct quotes support each major finding
- Insights distinguished from observations (what happened vs. what it means)
- Recommendations are specific and tied to findings
- Minority views and contradictory data acknowledged
- Participant anonymity preserved appropriately
- Research questions/objectives stated for context

Fail if any are true:
- Findings presented without supporting evidence
- Vague quantification ("some users," "a few participants")
- Quotes edited to change meaning
- Recommendations not traceable to specific findings
- Cherry-picked data that ignores contradictory evidence
- Researcher interpretation presented as participant statement
- Missing methodology section
- Overgeneralization from small sample
- Confidential or identifying information exposed
- Single participant observation presented as pattern
