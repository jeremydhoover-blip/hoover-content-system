# Writing Research Summaries

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Raw research findings or synthesis document
- Target audience (executives, designers, engineers, PMs)
- Summary length constraint (brief, standard, detailed)
- Key decisions the summary should inform

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify the audience and their decision-making needs
2. Extract the 3-5 most impactful findings from raw research
3. Prioritize findings by relevance to audience goals
4. Write the summary using the appropriate template for audience type
5. Add clear recommendations tied to specific findings
6. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Summary structure and required sections
- **Medium**: Finding prioritization based on audience needs
- **High**: Narrative framing and recommendation specificity

## State awareness
- If audience is executives: lead with business impact, minimize methodology
- If audience is designers: emphasize user behaviors and pain points
- If audience is engineers: include technical constraints users mentioned
- If multiple audiences: create layered summary with TL;DR + details

## Failure modes to avoid
- Burying key insights in methodology description
- Including findings without clear "so what" implications
- Using research jargon with non-research audiences
- Presenting all findings as equally important
- Omitting confidence levels or sample context
