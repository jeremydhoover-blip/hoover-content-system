# Analyzing Survey Results

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Survey data (responses, sample size, collection method)
- Survey design (question types, scales, skip logic)
- Business context (what decisions the survey should inform)
- Audience for findings (executives, product, research)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Assess data quality (response rate, completion rate, sample representativeness)
2. Analyze closed-ended questions (frequencies, means, distributions)
3. Identify significant patterns and segments
4. Analyze open-ended responses (theme coding)
5. Synthesize findings with data quality caveats
6. Write recommendations tied to specific data points
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Statistical accuracy, data quality reporting
- **Medium**: Emphasis and prioritization of findings
- **High**: Narrative framing, recommendation specificity

## State awareness
- If sample size is small (<100): report directional findings, avoid percentages implying precision
- If response rate is low (<20%): flag non-response bias risk
- If scale data: report means with distribution shape
- If NPS/CSAT: include benchmarks for context
- If segments differ significantly: lead with segment analysis

## Failure modes to avoid
- Presenting percentages without sample sizes
- Over-interpreting small differences as meaningful
- Ignoring non-response and selection bias
- Cherry-picking data that supports a narrative
- Presenting findings without actionable recommendations
- Missing key segment differences
