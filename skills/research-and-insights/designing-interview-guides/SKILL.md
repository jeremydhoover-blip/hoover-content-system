# Designing Interview Guides

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Research objectives (what decisions need to be informed)
- Participant type (user segment, role, experience level)
- Interview format (duration, moderated/unmoderated, remote/in-person)
- Topic scope (specific feature, broad workflow, exploratory)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define learning objectives (3-5 specific questions research must answer)
2. Map objectives to interview sections
3. Write opening and rapport-building questions
4. Write core questions progressing from broad to specific
5. Add probing questions for each core question
6. Write closing and wrap-up section
7. Review for timing and question balance
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Learning objectives must be explicit; core questions required
- **Medium**: Question wording and probing approach
- **High**: Icebreaker style, closing format, probe selection during interview

## State awareness
- If research is exploratory: weight toward open questions, fewer assumptions
- If research is evaluative: include specific stimuli and direct questions
- If participants are experts: skip basic context questions
- If participants are new users: add orientation and definition checks
- If sensitive topic: add extra rapport building, indirect approaches

## Failure modes to avoid
- Leading questions that suggest expected answers
- Double-barreled questions (asking two things at once)
- Assuming shared vocabulary without checking
- Front-loading difficult or sensitive questions
- Missing critical probes for ambiguous responses
- Running over time due to too many questions
