## Moderator notes
- **Key probes to prioritize**: "Can you give me an example?" and "How long does that take?"

## Moderator notes
- **Key probes to prioritize**: Open-ended context probes—let them tell the story
- **Time risk areas**: Section 2 may run long—let it; this is the core
- **Sensitive topics**: 
  - Don't assume financial difficulty—could be usage-based decision
  - Avoid "why did you cancel" framing—use "what was happening" instead
  - If they mention money directly, acknowledge without probing further unless they elaborate
- **Fallback phrases**:
  - "That makes sense."
  - "I appreciate you sharing that."
  - "There's no wrong answer here—I'm just trying to understand."
```
