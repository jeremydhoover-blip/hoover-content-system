# Question Types for Interviews

## Question type reference

### Grand tour questions
Open-ended questions that invite participants to describe their world.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Understand workflow | "Walk me through a typical day when you're doing [task]." |
| Explore context | "Tell me about the last time you [activity]." |
| Map process | "Can you describe what happens from [start] to [end]?" |

**Use when**: Opening a new topic, exploring unfamiliar territory.

**Avoid when**: You need specific information efficiently.

---

### Experience questions
Questions about specific past events (more reliable than hypotheticals).

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Concrete behavior | "Tell me about the last time you [did X]." |
| Critical incident | "Can you describe a time when [something went wrong]?" |
| Success case | "Tell me about a time when [this worked really well]." |

**Use when**: You want real behaviors, not idealized or hypothetical ones.

**Avoid when**: The experience is too rare to recall reliably.

---

### Process questions
Questions about how things work step-by-step.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Sequence | "What happens first? And then?" |
| Decision points | "How do you decide [which option to choose]?" |
| Handoffs | "When you finish [X], what happens to it next?" |

**Use when**: Mapping workflows, understanding task flows.

**Avoid when**: Process is highly variable (ask for examples instead).

---

### Opinion questions
Questions about attitudes, preferences, and judgments.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Preference | "Which approach do you prefer, and why?" |
| Importance | "How important is [X] to you?" |
| Satisfaction | "How satisfied are you with [current state]?" |

**Use when**: Understanding values, priorities, and satisfaction.

**Avoid when**: You need behavioral data (opinions ≠ behaviors).

---

### Feeling questions
Questions about emotional responses.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Emotional state | "How did you feel when [that happened]?" |
| Frustration | "What's the most frustrating part of [process]?" |
| Confidence | "How confident do you feel about [decision/task]?" |

**Use when**: Understanding emotional experience, pain points.

**Avoid when**: Participant isn't comfortable sharing emotions.

---

### Knowledge questions
Questions about what participants know or understand.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Awareness | "How did you learn about [X]?" |
| Understanding | "What do you think [X] does?" |
| Mental model | "How do you think [system] works?" |

**Use when**: Testing comprehension, uncovering mental models.

**Avoid when**: It could feel like a quiz (frame as curiosity, not test).

---

### Hypothetical questions (use sparingly)
Questions about imagined scenarios.

| Purpose | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Feature value | "If you could change one thing about [X], what would it be?" |
| Future behavior | "What would you do if [scenario]?" |
| Ideal state | "In an ideal world, how would [X] work?" |

**Use when**: Exploring aspirations, ideal states, feature priorities.

**Avoid when**: You need to predict actual behavior (hypotheticals are unreliable).

## Probe types

### Elaboration probes
Get more detail on what was said.

| Probe | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| "Tell me more about that." | Response was brief |
| "What do you mean by [term they used]?" | Clarifying vocabulary |
| "Can you give me an example?" | Response was abstract |
| "What happened next?" | Continuing a story |

### Clarification probes
Ensure you understood correctly.

| Probe | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| "So if I understand correctly, you're saying [X]?" | Confirming interpretation |
| "When you say [term], what do you mean?" | Ambiguous language |
| "Is that [A] or [B]?" | Narrowing meaning |

### Deepening probes
Explore underlying reasons.

| Probe | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| "Why is that?" | Understanding motivation |
| "What makes you say that?" | Understanding reasoning |
| "How did you come to that conclusion?" | Tracing thought process |
| "What's behind that for you?" | Deeper motivation |

### Completion probes
Fill in gaps.

| Probe | Use when |
|-------|----------|
| "You mentioned X—what about Y?" | Missing context |
| "Earlier you said [X]. How does that connect to [Y]?" | Linking topics |
| "Is there anything else about [topic]?" | Ensuring completeness |

## Questions to avoid

### Leading questions
Suggest the expected answer.

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Don't you think the new design is better?" | "How does the new design compare to the old one?" |
| "Isn't it frustrating when [X]?" | "How do you feel about [X]?" |
| "You probably use [feature], right?" | "Which features do you use most?" |

### Double-barreled questions
Ask two things at once.

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Is it fast and easy to use?" | "How would you describe the speed?" / "How easy is it to use?" |
| "How satisfied are you with the features and support?" | Ask separately |

### Loaded questions
Contain assumptions or charged language.

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Why do you waste time on [X]?" | "How much time do you spend on [X]?" |
| "What problems does [X] cause?" | "Tell me about your experience with [X]." |

### Closed questions without follow-up
Get only yes/no with no insight.

| ❌ Don't | ✅ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Do you like [feature]?" (stop) | "Do you like [feature]?" → "What do you like about it?" |
| "Is this useful?" (stop) | "Is this useful?" → "In what situations?" |

## Question sequencing

### Funnel pattern (most common)
Broad → Specific

```
1. Grand tour / context question
2. Experience question (specific instance)
3. Process question (how it works)
4. Opinion/feeling question
5. Hypothetical / future question
```

### Inverted funnel (for sensitive topics)
Specific → Broad

```
1. Safe, factual question
2. Specific, concrete question
3. Broader context question
4. Sensitive opinion/feeling question
```

### Parallel pattern (for comparisons)
Same questions for different contexts

```
1. "How do you do [X] for [situation A]?"
2. "How do you do [X] for [situation B]?"
3. "How are those different?"
```
