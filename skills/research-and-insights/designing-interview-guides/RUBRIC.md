- [ ] No double-barreled questions (asking two things at once)
- [ ] No leading questions that suggest expected answers
- [ ] Each core question has at least one probe

## Fail criteria
Fail if any are true:

- [ ] No explicit learning objectives stated
- [ ] Leading question present (e.g., "Don't you think X is better?")
- [ ] Double-barreled question present (e.g., "Is it fast and easy?")
- [ ] Yes/no questions without follow-up probes
- [ ] More questions than time allows (>1 core question per 3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Sensitive questions appear before rapport is established
- [ ] Jargon used without definition check for non-expert participants
- [ ] No probes for critical questions
- [ ] Missing consent/recording notice

## Question quality checks

### Opening questions
- [ ] First question is easy and low-stakes
- [ ] Warm-up builds rapport before diving into core topics

### Core questions
- [ ] Open-ended (start with "how," "what," "tell me about")
- [ ] Neutral (don't reveal desired answer)
- [ ] Single-focus (one topic per question)
- [ ] Participant can answer from their experience (not hypothetical)

### Probes
- [ ] Include "why" and "tell me more" probes
- [ ] Include clarifying probes ("what do you mean by X?")
- [ ] Include example probes ("can you give me an example?")

### Closing questions
- [ ] Include summary check for accuracy
- [ ] Include open invitation for additional thoughts
