Pass if all are true:
- Volume, source, and time period clearly stated
- Themes are quantified with counts and percentages
- Representative quotes included for each major theme
- Sentiment classifications explained (how positive/negative determined)
- Trend analysis included where time-series data available
- Methodology section documents coding approach and limitations
- Recommendations are specific and tied to themes
- Low-frequency signals acknowledged but not over-weighted
- Analysis acknowledges selection biases in feedback data
- Positive and negative patterns both represented (not just problems)

Fail if any are true:
- Claims made without quantification ("many users complained")
- Single complaint treated as systemic issue
- Quotes edited to change meaning or emphasis
- Missing methodology or limitations section
- Sentiment analysis without explanation of criteria
- Feedback source biases not acknowledged
- Recommendations not traceable to specific feedback patterns
- Cherry-picked quotes that misrepresent overall sentiment
- Confidential customer information exposed
- Analysis scope creep (answering questions data can't support)
