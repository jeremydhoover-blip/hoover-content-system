# Structuring Content Audit Reports

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Audit scope (full site, section, content type)
- Audit criteria used (quality, accuracy, performance, accessibility)
- Primary audience for report (content team, leadership, product)
- Key questions stakeholders need answered
- Action timeline (immediate fixes vs. long-term roadmap)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Clarify report audience and their decision-making needs.
2. Summarize audit methodology: scope, criteria, sample size.
3. Present quantitative overview first: inventory size, scores, distributions.
4. Group findings by action type: keep, update, merge, remove.
5. Prioritize findings: high-traffic first, then business-critical.
6. Provide specific examples for each finding category.
7. Map findings to effort estimates.
8. Create clear next steps with owners and timelines.
9. Include appendix with full data for those who need it.
10. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Accurate data representation, methodology transparency
- **Medium freedom**: Prioritization framework, visualization choices, grouping strategy
- **High freedom**: Narrative framing, executive summary emphasis, recommendation scope

Default: Lead with findings that enable decisions. Save detailed inventory for appendix.
