# Designing Content Governance Flows

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Content types to govern (UI copy, docs, marketing, legal)
- Stakeholders and their roles (creators, reviewers, approvers, publishers)
- Current pain points (bottlenecks, inconsistency, compliance risks)
- Constraints (legal requirements, release cycles, team capacity)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Inventory all content types that require governance.
2. Map current state: who creates, reviews, approves, publishes each type.
3. Identify failure modes: what breaks, what delays, what gets skipped.
4. Define roles with explicit permissions and responsibilities.
5. Design review flows with clear entry/exit criteria.
6. Build escalation paths for exceptions.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Governance structure and role definitions must be explicit. Ambiguity causes bottlenecks.
- **Allowed variation**: Specific flow steps may vary by content type, as long as accountability is clear.
