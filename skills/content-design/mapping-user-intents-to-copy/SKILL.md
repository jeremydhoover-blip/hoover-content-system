# Mapping User Intents to Copy

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- User research (goals, mental models, vocabulary)
- Feature or screen to write copy for
- Task flow and decision points
- Existing terminology in the product

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify user intents at each point in the flow (what they want to accomplish).
2. Map intent to mental model (how they think about the task).
3. Extract user vocabulary (words they use, not product jargon).
4. Translate intent + vocabulary into copy that bridges product capability and user expectation.
5. Validate alignment: does copy meet user where they are?
6. Document mismatches between system model and user model.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium freedom**: Intent mapping framework is fixed; copy expression may vary to match voice and context.
- **Allowed variation**: Word choice within user vocabulary range, tone adaptation to screen context.
