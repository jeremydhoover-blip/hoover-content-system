# Rubric

## Pass if all are true:
- User intents are explicitly stated, not assumed (derived from research or behavioral analysis)
- Mental models are documented (how users think about the task, not just what they do)
- User vocabulary is captured and compared to system terminology
- Vocabulary reconciliation decisions are explicit (when to use user term vs. product term)
- Copy recommendations bridge user intent and product capability
- Alignment score or assessment exists for each element
- Mismatches are documented with remediation path
- Copy addresses what users would ask at each point, not just what system does
- Emotional state is considered (copy tone matches user context)
- Intent sources are cited (research, support tickets, analytics—not assumption)

## Fail if any are true:
- Intents are invented without research or behavioral evidence
- Mental model is confused with task (what they do vs. how they think)
- User vocabulary is ignored in favor of product terminology
- Copy uses system-centric language that doesn't match user vocabulary
- No reconciliation strategy for vocabulary mismatches
- Alignment is claimed without comparison to actual user language
- Copy addresses product features without connecting to user goals
- Emotional state is ignored (same tone for anxious error state and neutral browsing)
- Intent map covers happy path only (ignores error states, edge cases)
