## Intent-to-copy map
Use this structure for each screen or flow:

```md
## Intent map: [Screen/feature name]

### User context
- **Primary persona**: [Who is this user]
- **Task context**: [What brought them here]
- **Expertise level**: [Novice / Intermediate / Expert]
- **Emotional state**: [Neutral / Eager / Frustrated / Anxious]

### Intent inventory

| UI Element | User intent | Mental model | User vocabulary | System term | Copy recommendation |
|------------|-------------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|---------------------|
| [Element] | [What user wants] | [How they think about it] | [Words they use] | [Our term] | [Recommended copy] |

### Vocabulary reconciliation

| User says | System says | Resolution |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| [User term] | [Product term] | [Use user term / Bridge both / Educate user] |

### Intent-copy alignment score
For each element, rate alignment 1-5:
- 5: Copy exactly matches user intent and vocabulary
- 4: Copy matches intent, vocabulary slightly different
- 3: Intent met but vocabulary requires learning
- 2: Partial intent match, vocabulary mismatch
- 1: Copy contradicts user expectation
```

## Intent analysis template
Use when researching user intents:

```md
## Intent analysis: [Feature area]

### Research inputs
- Source: [User research, support tickets, analytics, etc.]
- Sample size: [Number of users/data points]
- Date: [When research conducted]

### Intent clusters

**Intent cluster 1: [Name]**
- Description: [What users want to do]
- Frequency: [How often this intent appears]
- Current success rate: [How often users succeed]
- Sample quotes:
  - "[Quote 1]"
  - "[Quote 2]"
- Vocabulary patterns: [Words users consistently use]

**Intent cluster 2: [Name]**
[Repeat structure]

### Intent vs. feature gap analysis

| User intent | Product capability | Gap | Recommended action |
|-------------|-------------------|-----|-------------------|
| [Intent] | [Feature that serves it] | [Mismatch if any] | [Copy fix / Feature change / Education] |
```

## Copy-intent validation checklist
Use before finalizing copy:

```md
## Validation: [Screen name]

For each copy element, verify:

| Element | Intent match | Vocabulary match | Action clear | Question addressed |
|---------|--------------|------------------|--------------|-------------------|
| [Copy] | [Yes/No/Partial] | [User term/Bridge/System term] | [Yes/No] | [What user would ask] |

### Mismatch remediation
| Element | Issue | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| [Copy] | [What's wrong] | [Recommended change] |
```
