# Rubric

## Pass if all are true:
- Name describes functionality without requiring explanation
- Name fits user's existing mental model (uses familiar vocabulary)
- Name is consistent with existing product naming patterns
- At least 3 candidates were evaluated before selection
- Each candidate has explicit scoring rationale
- Character constraints are verified (name fits all required contexts)
- Localization viability is assessed (no idioms, puns, or culturally specific references)
- Trademark/conflict check is documented (even if informal)
- Rejected alternatives include specific rejection reasons
- Name works as a standalone reference (doesn't require surrounding context to understand)

## Fail if any are true:
- Name requires marketing explanation to understand (invented words without clear meaning)
- Name contradicts existing naming patterns without justification
- Only one name was considered (no alternatives evaluated)
- Name relies on puns, wordplay, or idioms that won't localize
- Evaluation criteria are subjective ("sounds better") without measurable dimensions
- Name conflicts with existing features or industry-standard terms used differently
- Name is longer than UI constraints allow
- Name uses jargon unknown to target users
- Scoring rationale is missing or identical across all candidates
