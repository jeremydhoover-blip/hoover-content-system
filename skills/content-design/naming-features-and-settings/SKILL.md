# Naming Features and Settings

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Feature purpose and core functionality
- Target user mental model (how users think about this concept)
- Existing naming patterns in the product
- Constraints (character limits, localization, trademark concerns)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define what the feature/setting does in one sentence.
2. Identify the user's mental model and vocabulary for this concept.
3. Generate 3-5 candidate names following naming patterns.
4. Evaluate each candidate against rubric criteria.
5. Test for conflicts (existing features, trademark, localization).
6. Select recommended name with rationale.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium freedom**: Naming structure follows patterns, but final word choice requires judgment.
- **Allowed variation**: Creative exploration in candidate generation, as long as evaluation criteria are applied consistently.
