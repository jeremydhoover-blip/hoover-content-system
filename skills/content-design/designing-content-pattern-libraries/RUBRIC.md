# Rubric

## Pass if all are true:
- Each pattern has explicit trigger conditions (when to use)
- Structure is defined with placeholders, not just prose description
- Required vs. optional elements are distinguished
- Character limits or format constraints are specified where applicable
- At least 2 correct and 2 incorrect examples per pattern
- Incorrect examples include explanation of why they fail
- Variation boundaries are explicit (what can change, what cannot)
- Patterns are mutually exclusive or decision tree clarifies overlaps
- Edge cases are documented with handling guidance
- Patterns can be applied mechanically (no judgment calls left undefined)
- Global rules are documented once, not repeated in every pattern

## Fail if any are true:
- Pattern trigger is vague ("when appropriate", "as needed")
- Structure is described but not shown as template
- Examples only show correct usage (no failure examples)
- Incorrect examples lack explanation (just "wrong" without why)
- Variation boundaries are missing (everything seems flexible)
- Multiple patterns apply to same situation with no resolution guidance
- Patterns require significant interpretation to apply
- Character limits are missing for length-constrained contexts
- Edge cases are acknowledged but not solved ("use judgment")
- Patterns conflict with each other without acknowledgment
