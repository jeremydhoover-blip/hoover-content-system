# Designing Content Pattern Libraries

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Content types to systematize (errors, confirmations, actions, etc.)
- Existing examples of good and bad content
- Voice and tone parameters
- Constraints (platforms, character limits, localization)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify recurring content types that need consistency.
2. Analyze existing instances: what works, what varies, what breaks.
3. Extract the underlying pattern: structure, required elements, constraints.
4. Document the pattern with rules and rationale.
5. Provide correct and incorrect examples for each pattern.
6. Define variation boundaries (what can change, what cannot).
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Pattern structure and mandatory elements are fixed.
- **Allowed variation**: Specific word choice within pattern constraints, tone adaptation within defined range.
