## Pass if all are true:
- All decision points are identified and classified by load type
- Extraneous load sources have specific reduction strategies, not just "simplify"
- Intrinsic load is acknowledged as unavoidable (no false promises of elimination)
- Each reduction recommendation includes before/after comparison
- Risk check confirms essential information is preserved
- Recommendations use established strategies: chunking, defaults, progressive disclosure, recognition over recall
- User context (expertise, frequency, stress) informs reduction priorities
- Reductions are measurable (fewer clicks, words, decisions—not "feels simpler")
- Memory demands are addressed (user doesn't need to remember across screens)
- Solutions don't just hide complexity but resolve or restructure it

## Fail if any are true:
- Recommendations use vague language ("simplify", "make easier", "reduce clutter")
- Intrinsic load is misclassified as extraneous (promising to eliminate inherent complexity)
- Reductions remove essential information needed for task completion
- Analysis skips decision points or counts only visible UI elements
- User context is ignored (same recommendations for novice and expert users)
- Solutions rely entirely on hiding content without restructuring
- No before/after comparison provided
- Reduction strategy is missing (problem identified but no solution)
- Recommendations conflict with accessibility requirements (e.g., removing necessary labels)
