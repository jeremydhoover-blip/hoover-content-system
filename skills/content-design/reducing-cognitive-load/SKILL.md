# Reducing Cognitive Load

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Screen or flow to analyze
- Primary user task and decision points
- Current content inventory (all visible text)
- User context (expertise level, task frequency, stress level)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Map all decision points user must navigate.
2. Identify cognitive load sources: memory demands, ambiguity, unnecessary choices, hidden information.
3. Classify each source by type: intrinsic (unavoidable complexity), extraneous (removable friction), germane (learning investment).
4. Prioritize extraneous load for elimination.
5. Apply reduction strategies: chunking, defaults, progressive disclosure, recognition over recall.
6. Validate that reductions don't remove essential information.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium freedom**: Load classification framework is fixed; specific reduction strategies may vary by context.
- **Allowed variation**: Reduction technique selection depends on screen type and user expertise.
