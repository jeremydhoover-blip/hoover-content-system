# Designing Microcopy Systems

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Component inventory (buttons, modals, forms, toasts, etc.)
- Existing design system documentation
- Product voice and tone parameters
- Platform constraints (character limits, localization requirements)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Inventory all UI components that require copy.
2. Categorize components by function: action, feedback, navigation, instruction, status.
3. Define copy slots for each component (label, helper text, error, success, placeholder).
4. Establish patterns for each slot: structure, tone, constraints.
5. Document variation rules (when deviation is allowed, when it is not).
6. Create usage examples showing correct and incorrect application.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Pattern definitions and constraint rules must be explicit and testable.
- **Allowed variation**: Example phrasing may adapt to product voice, as long as structural patterns remain consistent.
