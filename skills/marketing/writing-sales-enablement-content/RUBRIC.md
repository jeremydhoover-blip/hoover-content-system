# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Asset type structure followed completely (all required sections present)
- Content is scannable (bullets, headers, tables—not dense paragraphs)
- Language is speakable (talk tracks sound natural when read aloud)
- Proof points are specific (customer names, metrics, timeframes)
- Competitive claims are defensible and factual
- Talk tracks include questions, not just statements
- Objection handlers acknowledge before reframing
- Content is updated within last 90 days (no stale competitors/pricing)
- CTA or next step is clear and actionable

Fail if any are true:
- Missing required sections for asset type
- Dense paragraphs that can't be scanned during a call
- Talk tracks that sound scripted or robotic when spoken
- Vague proof points ("customers love it", "significant improvement")
- Competitor claims that are false or easily disproven
- Objection handlers that are dismissive or defensive
- No acknowledgment of competitor strengths where appropriate
- Missing pricing context when competitors undercut on price
- No clear next step or CTA
- Feature-focused instead of outcome-focused language
