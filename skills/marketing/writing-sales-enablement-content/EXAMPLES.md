# Examples

## Example 1: Battle card

**Input:**
- Our product: DataSync (data integration platform)
- Competitor: LegacyConnect
- Key differences: Real-time vs. batch, no-code vs. requires developers

**Output:**
```md
# Battle Card: DataSync vs. LegacyConnect

## Quick Facts
| Aspect | DataSync | LegacyConnect |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Positioning | Real-time data integration | Batch data integration |
| Pricing | Per connector/month | Per row processed |
| Target buyer | Data teams, ops | IT/Engineering |
| Key strength | Speed, no-code | Enterprise scale, legacy support |

## When We Win
- Prospect needs real-time data (live dashboards, instant sync)
- Team lacks engineering resources for custom development
- They've outgrown spreadsheet exports and manual processes
- Speed to deploy matters (weeks vs. months)

## When to Watch Out
- Heavy legacy mainframe integration requirements
- Prospect has large engineering team that prefers code-first
- Extremely high volume batch processing (billions of rows/day)

## Competitive Differentiators
1. **Real-time sync**: Data available in seconds, not hours. Critical for operational dashboards and time-sensitive workflows.
2. **No-code builder**: Business analysts can build integrations without developer tickets. Reduces backlog by 70% on average.
3. **Transparent pricing**: Flat per-connector pricing vs. unpredictable per-row costs that spike with growth.

## Talk Track: If Prospect Mentions LegacyConnect

> "LegacyConnect is solid for batch workloads. Here's what our customers who evaluated both found:
>
> If real-time matters—like powering live dashboards or instant customer updates—DataSync handles that natively. LegacyConnect runs on schedules.
>
> Also, your data team can build and modify integrations themselves with DataSync, without waiting on engineering.
>
> Would it be helpful to see a side-by-side of how we'd handle your Salesforce-to-warehouse sync?"

## Objection Handlers

**"LegacyConnect handles more data sources than you."**
> "They do have more legacy connectors—especially mainframe. If that's critical for you, it's worth understanding. For cloud and SaaS apps, we're comparable. What sources are must-haves for you?"

**"LegacyConnect is cheaper."**
> "Their per-row pricing can look lower initially, but customers often see 2-3x cost increases as data volume grows. Our per-connector pricing stays flat. Want me to model your expected costs at 2x current volume?"

## Proof Points
- **TechCorp**: Reduced data latency from 4 hours to 30 seconds; freed 2 FTE from manual integration work
- **Gartner Peer Insights**: 4.6 stars vs. LegacyConnect 4.1 for ease of use

## Example 2: One-pager

**Input:**
- Product: CloudGuard security monitoring
- Audience: IT Security Managers
- Use case: Cloud security posture management

**Output:**
```md
# CloudGuard

## See your cloud security posture in one view

### The Challenge
Cloud environments grow faster than security teams can track. Misconfigurations slip through. Compliance gaps go unnoticed until audits—or breaches—expose them.

### The Solution
CloudGuard continuously monitors your AWS, Azure, and GCP environments for security risks, misconfigurations, and compliance violations. Get actionable alerts, not alert fatigue.

### Key Benefits
- **Continuous visibility**: Real-time inventory and risk scoring across all cloud accounts
- **Prioritized remediation**: Focus on what matters—risks ranked by exploitability and blast radius
- **Compliance automation**: Map controls to SOC 2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS with one-click reports

### How It Works
1. Connect cloud accounts via read-only API access (10-minute setup)
2. CloudGuard scans configurations, IAM policies, and network rules
3. Receive prioritized findings with remediation steps
4. Track improvement over time with security posture scoring

### Results
> "We found 47 critical misconfigurations in week one that our previous tool missed. CloudGuard paid for itself before the trial ended."
> — Sarah Chen, Security Lead, FinanceApp

**73%** reduction in mean time to remediate
**90%** fewer false positives than legacy CSPM tools

## Example 3: Objection handler

**Input:**
- Product: Enterprise software ($50K+ ACV)
- Common objection: "We need to involve more stakeholders"

**Output:**
```md
## Objection: "We need to get more stakeholders involved."

### What They're Really Saying
- Decision requires buy-in from multiple people
- They may not have internal authority to decide alone
- They might be using this to slow down or exit the conversation

### Response Strategy
**Acknowledge** → **Offer help** → **Qualify**

### Talk Track

> "Totally understand—decisions like this usually involve multiple perspectives. Happy to help make that process easier.
>
> A few questions:
> - Who else would need to be involved in evaluating this?
> - What would be most helpful for them—a technical deep-dive, ROI analysis, or executive summary?
> - Would it make sense to set up a session where we can address everyone's questions at once?
>
> I can also share a one-pager and business case template that our customers have found useful for building internal alignment."

### Materials to Offer
- Executive summary (2-page PDF)
- ROI calculator (spreadsheet)
- Security and compliance documentation
- Reference customer contacts for peer conversations

### Red Flag Signals
- Unable to name specific stakeholders → may not be a real buyer
- Unwilling to schedule follow-up → likely disengaging
- "I'll share internally and get back to you" with no timeline → needs gentle pressure

### Follow-up
If they agree to involve stakeholders:
> "Great. Let's put 30 minutes on the calendar for [date]. In the meantime, I'll send over materials they can review. Who should I copy on that email?"

## Example 4: Talk track for discovery call

**Input:**
- Stage: Discovery
- Persona: VP of Marketing
- Product: Marketing analytics platform

**Output:**
```md
# Talk Track: Discovery Call — VP of Marketing

## Context
- **Stage**: Initial discovery
- **Persona**: VP of Marketing at mid-market B2B company
- **Goal**: Understand current analytics setup, identify pain points, qualify opportunity

## Opening
> "Thanks for making time. I've done some homework on [Company]—it looks like you're scaling demand gen efforts significantly this year. Before I share anything about us, I'd love to understand what's working and what's not with how you currently measure marketing performance."

Wait for response. Listen for: Fragmented tools, attribution challenges, reporting delays, exec visibility issues.

## Discovery Questions
1. "How do you currently track which campaigns are driving pipeline?"
2. "When your CEO asks 'what's working?', how quickly can you answer with confidence?"
3. "What's the biggest gap in your current marketing data setup?"
4. "Walk me through what happens when you need to report on marketing ROI for the board."

## Transition to Solution
> "Based on what you've shared about [specific pain—e.g., 'spending hours stitching together reports'], let me show you how [Product] can give you that single view without the manual work..."

## Key Messages to Land
- Single source of truth across all channels (no more spreadsheet stitching)
- Attribution that connects campaigns to closed revenue (not just leads)
- Dashboards that update in real-time (no waiting for monthly reports)

## Handling Common Responses
**If they say "We use [Competitor] already"**: "How's that working for you? What would you change if you could?"
**If they push back on "We don't have time for a new tool"**: "Totally get it. What if I showed you how customers typically get live in under 2 weeks with minimal lift?"

## Close
> "Based on what we've discussed, I think there's a fit here. Would it make sense to schedule a deeper dive where I can show you exactly how we'd handle [their specific use case]?"

**Goal**: Secure demo with relevant stakeholders identified.
