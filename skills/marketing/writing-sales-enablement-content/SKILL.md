# Writing sales enablement content

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Asset type (battle card, one-pager, talk track, objection handler, deck)
- Target buyer persona
- Sales stage (prospecting, discovery, demo, negotiation, close)
- Product/solution focus
- Key competitors (if battle card)
- Common objections (if handler)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify asset type and extract structure from [reference/asset-types.md](reference/asset-types.md).
2. Determine sales stage and buyer persona context.
3. Gather product facts, differentiators, and proof points.
4. Draft content optimized for sales use (scannable, speakable, shareable).
5. Include competitor positioning where relevant.
6. Add talk track language (how to say it, not just what).
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Asset structure and required sections are fixed per type.
- **Medium**: Messaging emphasis, proof point selection, talk track phrasing.
- Allowed variation: Tone intensity, competitive framing, persona-specific emphasis—as long as rubric passes.
