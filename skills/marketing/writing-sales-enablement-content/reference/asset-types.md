## Asset creation checklist

Before publishing any sales enablement asset:

- [ ] Reviewed by sales rep for realism ("Would you actually use this?")
- [ ] Fact-checked by product marketing (claims, pricing, roadmap)
- [ ] Legal review if competitive claims or guarantees
- [ ] Version dated and change log maintained
- [ ] Distributed via accessible system (not buried in folders)
- [ ] Training session scheduled if complex or new
- [ ] Feedback mechanism established (how to report issues)
