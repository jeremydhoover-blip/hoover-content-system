# Writing Product Messaging

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Product capabilities and key differentiators
- Target audience and their primary pain points
- Competitive landscape and positioning
- Brand voice and tone guidelines

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define the target audience and their context
2. Identify the primary problem the product solves
3. Articulate the unique value proposition
4. Draft positioning statement
5. Create supporting messages for key benefits
6. Test messages against competitive alternatives
7. Validate voice and tone alignment
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium**: Messaging structure is fixed; specific language and emphasis may vary
- Allowed variation: Message length for different channels; emphasis based on audience segment

## Failure modes to avoid
- Feature-focused messaging that ignores user benefits
- Generic value propositions that apply to any competitor
- Jargon that requires industry knowledge
- Promises that the product cannot deliver
