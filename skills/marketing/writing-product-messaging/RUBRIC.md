Pass if all are true:
- Positioning statement follows For/Who/Is/That/Unlike/Our format
- Value proposition headline communicates end benefit, not feature
- Target audience is specific enough to exclude some people
- Pain point is stated from user's perspective, not company's
- Key benefit is believable and demonstrable
- Differentiation is specific to this product (not true of all competitors)
- Messages are free of undefined jargon
- Proof points are concrete (numbers, names, verifiable claims)
- Messaging hierarchy has clear primary → secondary structure
- Competitive positioning avoids naming competitors disparagingly

Fail if any are true:
- Value proposition is a feature list, not benefit statement
- Target audience is "everyone" or undefined
- Differentiation claim applies equally to competitors
- Contains unsubstantiated superlatives ("best", "leading", "revolutionary")
- Pain point is assumed rather than researched
- Missing proof points or credibility markers
- Messaging is interchangeable with competitor's
- Uses internal jargon or undefined acronyms
