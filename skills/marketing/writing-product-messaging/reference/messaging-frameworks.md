## Core frameworks

### The positioning statement framework
The classic Geoffrey Moore structure from "Crossing the Chasm."

```
For [target customer]
Who [statement of need]
[Product] is a [product category]
That [key benefit]
Unlike [competitive alternative]
Our product [primary differentiation]
```

**When to use**: Foundational positioning, internal alignment, brand guidelines
**Strengths**: Forces specificity on audience and differentiation
**Limitations**: Too structured for consumer-facing copy

### The value proposition canvas
Connects customer jobs/pains/gains to product features/pain relievers/gain creators.

| Customer profile | Value map |
|------------------|-----------|
| Jobs to be done | Products & services that enable those jobs |
| Pains | Pain relievers |
| Gains | Gain creators |

**When to use**: Early product positioning, product-market fit validation
**Strengths**: Customer-centric, reveals gaps
**Limitations**: Doesn't prioritize; can be overwhelming

### The message hierarchy
Structures messages by importance and specificity.

```
Level 1: Brand essence (3-5 words)
Level 2: Value proposition (1 sentence)
Level 3: Key messages (3-5 supporting points)
Level 4: Proof points (evidence for each message)
Level 5: Audience variations (segment-specific emphasis)
```

**When to use**: Multi-channel campaigns, team alignment
**Strengths**: Scales across channels, maintains consistency
**Limitations**: Requires discipline to maintain hierarchy

## Value proposition models

### The headline formula
Structure: [End benefit] + [Specific detail] + [Time frame or qualifier]

| Component | Purpose | Example |
|-----------|---------|---------|
| End benefit | What the user achieves | "Save 10 hours a week" |
| Specific detail | How or what | "with automated reporting" |
| Time frame | Credibility booster | "starting today" |

Full example: "Save 10 hours a week with automated reporting—starting today."

### The before/after/bridge model
Contrasts current pain with future state, bridged by product.

```
BEFORE: [Current painful situation]
AFTER: [Desired improved state]
BRIDGE: [How the product gets them there]
```

Example:
- Before: Spending Sundays updating spreadsheets
- After: Real-time visibility into your business metrics
- Bridge: DataDash connects to your tools and builds dashboards automatically

### The unique mechanism model
Explains WHY your product delivers the benefit (creates credibility).

```
[Benefit] because [unique mechanism]
```

Example: "Find root causes in 60 seconds because our AI traces every request across your entire stack automatically."

**When to use**: Complex products, skeptical audiences, competitive markets
**Why it works**: Addresses the implicit "how?" that causes skepticism

## Competitive positioning

### Positioning strategies

| Strategy | When to use | Example framing |
|----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Head-to-head | You're better at the same thing | "Faster, more accurate, easier" |
| Differentiated | You solve differently | "The only X that does Y" |
| Niche | You serve a specific segment better | "Built for [specific audience]" |
| Category creation | No direct comparison exists | "The first [new category]" |

### Competitive comparison rules

**Do**:
- Name your category, not competitors
- Focus on what you enable, not what they lack
- Use objective, verifiable claims
- Let the difference be obvious

**Don't**:
- Name competitors in marketing copy (with exceptions)
- Use negative language about alternatives
- Make claims you can't prove
- Assume the audience knows the competitor

### The "unlike" statement
Positions against the alternative without attack.

```
Unlike [category/approach], [Product] [differentiated benefit].
```

Examples:
- "Unlike manual budgeting apps, Pocket tracks your spending automatically."
- "Unlike generic monitoring, WatchTower tells you why something failed."

## Message testing

### The "so what?" test
For every message, ask "so what?" until you reach user impact.

```
Message: "We use AI-powered analysis"
So what? → "It finds patterns humans miss"
So what? → "You catch issues before customers do"
So what? → "Fewer support tickets and happier customers"
✓ Use the final answer as your message
```

### The competitor substitution test
Replace your product name with a competitor's. Does the message still work?

| Outcome | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Works for competitor too | Not differentiated enough—revise |
| Clearly doesn't fit | Good differentiation |
| Partially fits | Sharpen the specific detail |

### The specificity test
Check for weasel words and vague claims.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Industry-leading" | "Used by 8 of the top 10 banks" |
| "Easy to use" | "Set up in under 5 minutes" |
| "Powerful" | "Processes 1M events per second" |
| "Better" | "3x faster at half the cost" |

### The internal vs. external test
Messages that resonate internally often don't work externally.

| Internal framing | External framing |
|------------------|------------------|
| "Our proprietary algorithm" | "Automatic optimization" |
| "World-class engineering" | "99.99% uptime" |
| "Best-in-class support" | "Chat with a human in under 2 minutes" |
