# Writing Email Campaigns

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Campaign goal (nurture, convert, retain, re-engage)
- Audience segment and relationship stage
- Key message and desired action
- Sequence length and send cadence

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define campaign goal and success metrics
2. Map audience segment and their current state
3. Plan sequence structure and email count
4. Write subject lines that drive opens
5. Draft body copy focused on single CTA per email
6. Create preview text that complements subject
7. Build sequence logic (triggers, timing, conditions)
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium**: Email structure follows proven patterns; tone and specific messaging vary by brand
- Allowed variation: Sequence length; send timing; visual element recommendations

## Failure modes to avoid
- Multiple CTAs competing for attention
- Subject lines that mislead about content
- Walls of text that bury the CTA
- Generic copy that ignores segmentation
