## Sequence types

### Welcome sequence
Onboards new subscribers and establishes relationship.

```
Purpose: Build engagement, set expectations, deliver quick value
Typical length: 3-5 emails
Timing: First email immediate, then daily or every 2 days

Standard progression:
1. Welcome + what to expect
2. Quick win or key resource
3. Feature/benefit highlight
4. Social proof or case study
5. Ask for engagement (reply, follow, etc.)
```

### Trial nurture sequence
Converts free trial users to paid customers.

```
Purpose: Demonstrate value, address objections, create urgency
Typical length: 5-7 emails
Timing: Aligned to trial length (e.g., 14-day trial = 5-6 emails)

2. Quick win guide (day 2-3)
3. Feature spotlight (day 5-7)
4. Social proof (day 7-9)
5. Objection handling (day 10-11)

```

### Re-engagement sequence
Reactivates dormant subscribers or users.

3. Last chance / confirm interest
```

Builds loyalty and reduces buyer's remorse.

```
Purpose: Confirm purchase, enable success, encourage next step
Typical length: 3-4 emails

1. Order confirmation + what's next (immediate)
2. Getting started / tips (day 3-5)

4. Related products or referral ask (day 21-30)
```

### Event/launch sequence
Builds anticipation and drives attendance or purchases.

## Subject line patterns

### Pattern: Curiosity gap
Creates intrigue without being clickbait.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Incomplete thought | "The one thing most marketers miss" |
| Surprising claim | "We deleted our best feature" |
| Insider knowledge | "What [industry] won't tell you" |

### Pattern: Benefit-forward
States clear value proposition.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Outcome promise | "Write emails 3x faster" |
| Problem solved | "No more spreadsheet chaos" |
| Transformation | "From stuck to shipped" |

### Pattern: Urgency/scarcity
Creates time pressure (use sparingly).

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Deadline | "Ends tonight" |
| Limited quantity | "Only 50 spots left" |
| Price increase | "Last day at this price" |

### Pattern: Personalization
Uses recipient-specific data.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Name | "[Name], your account is ready" |
| Behavior | "You left something behind" |
| Segment | "For [industry] teams like yours" |

### Pattern: Question
Engages by prompting mental response.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| Direct question | "Still looking for [solution]?" |
| Rhetorical | "What if reports wrote themselves?" |
| Challenge | "Can you name all 5?" |

## Timing and cadence

### General guidelines

| Sequence type | Email frequency | Total duration |
|---------------|-----------------|----------------|
| Welcome | Daily or every 2 days | 1-2 weeks |
| Trial nurture | Every 2-3 days | Trial length |
| Re-engagement | Every 3-5 days | 10-14 days |
| Promotional | Daily during event | Event duration |
| Newsletter | Weekly or biweekly | Ongoing |

### Optimal send times (general benchmarks)
| Audience type | Best days | Best times |
|---------------|-----------|------------|
| B2B | Tuesday-Thursday | 9-11 AM, 1-3 PM |
| B2C | Varies by industry | Evenings, weekends |
| Mixed | Mid-week | Late morning |

**Note**: Always test for your specific audience. These are starting points.

### Frequency rules
- **New subscribers**: Higher frequency acceptable (building habit)
- **Established subscribers**: Respect inbox; quality over quantity
- **Re-engagement**: Lower frequency; don't spam disengaged users
- **Promotional**: Can increase during events, but have exit ramps

## Performance optimization

### Key metrics and benchmarks

| Metric | Good | Excellent | Red flag |
|--------|------|-----------|----------|
| Open rate | 20-25% | 30%+ | <15% |
| Click rate | 2-3% | 5%+ | <1% |
| Click-to-open | 10-15% | 20%+ | <8% |
| Unsubscribe | <0.5% | <0.2% | >1% |

### A/B testing priorities

Test in this order (highest impact first):
1. **Subject line**: Test curiosity vs. benefit; length; personalization
2. **Send time**: Test day of week; time of day
3. **From name**: Test company vs. personal name
4. **CTA**: Test button text; placement; design
5. **Content length**: Test short vs. long; copy approaches

### Common fixes for underperformance

| Problem | Likely cause | Fix |
|---------|--------------|-----|
| Low open rate | Subject line not compelling | Test curiosity/benefit angles |
| Opens but no clicks | CTA buried or unclear | Move CTA up; simplify message |
| High unsubscribes | Too frequent or irrelevant | Reduce frequency; improve segmentation |
| Good clicks, no conversion | Landing page mismatch | Align page with email promise |

### List hygiene
- Remove hard bounces immediately
- Suppress users with no engagement after re-engagement sequence
- Segment by engagement level for frequency decisions
- Honor unsubscribes within 24 hours
