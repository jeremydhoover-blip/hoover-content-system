# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Subject line is ≤50 characters and drives curiosity or states clear benefit
- Preview text adds information (not just repeating subject)
- Each email has exactly one primary CTA
- CTA button text is action-oriented (starts with verb)
- Body copy is scannable (short paragraphs, clear sections)
- Opening hook establishes relevance within first two sentences
- Send timing is specified for each email in sequence
- Exit conditions prevent sending to converted/unsubscribed contacts
- Sequence has clear progression (each email has distinct purpose)
- Alt text is provided for all images

Fail if any are true:
- Subject line exceeds 50 characters or is misleading
- Multiple competing CTAs in single email
- Email body exceeds 200 words without strong justification
- No clear send trigger or timing
- Generic opening that could apply to any audience
- Sequence emails repeat the same message without progression
- Missing preview text
- CTA button says "Click here" or "Submit"
