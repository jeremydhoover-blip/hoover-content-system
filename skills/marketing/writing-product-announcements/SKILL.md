# Writing product announcements

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- What changed (feature, release, fix, deprecation)
- Announcement type (launch, update, deprecation, incident resolution)
- Target channels (email, blog, in-app, social, changelog)
- Target audience (all users, segment, developers, admins)
- Timeline (available now, rolling out, scheduled)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Classify announcement type and urgency level.
2. Identify primary channel and adapt format.
3. Write headline emphasizing user benefit or impact.
4. Structure body: what changed → why it matters → what to do.
5. Add timeline, availability, and any required actions.
6. Include CTA appropriate to channel.
7. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Deprecation and breaking change announcements must follow exact structure.
- **Medium**: Launch and update announcements can vary tone and structure for channel.
- Allowed variation: headline style, CTA phrasing, detail depth per channel—as long as rubric passes.
