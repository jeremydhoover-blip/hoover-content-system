# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Headline states the change or benefit, not just the feature name
- What changed is clear within the first two sentences
- Timeline or availability is explicitly stated
- User impact or benefit is explained (not just technical details)
- Required action (if any) is specific and actionable
- CTA matches the announcement type and channel
- Deprecation/breaking changes include deadline and migration path
- Tone matches urgency level (urgent for breaking, celebratory for launch)

Fail if any are true:
- Headline is vague ("Exciting news!" or "Big update")
- Missing when the change takes effect
- No clear "what to do" or next step
- Buries critical information (deadline, breaking behavior) below the fold
- Uses internal jargon without explanation
- Deprecation lacks recommended alternative or reason
- CTA is generic ("Click here") rather than action-specific
- Mixes multiple unrelated announcements in one message
