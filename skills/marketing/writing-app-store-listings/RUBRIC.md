Pass if all are true:
- App name is ≤30 characters and includes brand or primary keyword
- Subtitle (iOS) or short description (Android) is within limit and includes primary keyword
- First two lines of description communicate core value (visible before fold)
- Features are benefit-focused, not technical specifications
- At least 3-5 distinct features or capabilities listed
- Keywords are relevant and naturally integrated (not stuffed)
- CTA is present and actionable
- "What's New" reflects actual changes (not placeholder text)
- All character limits validated per platform

Fail if any are true:
- Exceeds any platform character limit
- Opening lines are generic ("Welcome to [App]!" or "The best app for...")
- Features describe how it works instead of what users can do
- Keyword stuffing that reads unnaturally
- Missing required fields for the platform
- "What's New" is empty or says only "Bug fixes"
- Uses competitor names or trademarked terms improperly
- Makes unverifiable claims ("Best app", "#1 rated" without source)
- Description is a wall of text without formatting or line breaks
