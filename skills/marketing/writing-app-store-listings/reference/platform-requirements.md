# Platform requirements

## Apple App Store (iOS)

| Field | Character Limit | Indexed for Search | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| App Name | 30 | Yes | Highest SEO weight. Include brand + keyword if possible. |
| Subtitle | 30 | Yes | High SEO value. Primary keyword here. |
| Promotional Text | 170 | No | Updatable without new build. Use for timely messages. |
| Description | 4000 | No | Not indexed; focus on conversion, not keywords. |
| Keywords | 100 | Yes | Comma-separated, no spaces. No duplicates of name/subtitle. |
| What's New | 4000 | No | Per version. Describe actual changes. |

### iOS-specific rules
- Keywords field: Avoid spaces after commas to maximize characters.
- Don't repeat words from app name or subtitle in keywords field.
- Singular vs. plural: Choose one form (Apple handles variations).
- Competitor names: Prohibited in keywords field.
- Promotional text: Best place for seasonal messages, sales, or events.

### iOS keyword optimization
**Do include**:
- Primary function keywords
- Use case terms (how users describe their goal)
- Misspellings of your app name (if common)
- Category-relevant terms

**Don't include**:
- Generic terms (app, free, best)
- Competitor trademarked names
- Irrelevant category terms
- Duplicates of name/subtitle words

## Google Play Store (Android)

| Field | Character Limit | Indexed for Search | Notes |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|-------|
| App Name | 30 | Yes | Highest weight. Brand + keyword recommended. |
| Short Description | 80 | Yes | High SEO value. Critical for search ranking. |
| Full Description | 4000 | Yes | Indexed. Include keywords naturally throughout. |
| What's New | 500 | No | Shorter than iOS. Be concise. |

### Android-specific rules
- Full description IS indexed—keyword placement matters.
- First 80 characters of description visible before fold.
- No separate keyword field; embed in title, short desc, and full desc.
- Formatting (bullets, line breaks) renders in Play Store.
- Emojis/symbols (★, •, ✓) allowed and render correctly.

### Android keyword strategy
**Placement priority**:
1. App name (highest weight)
2. Short description (high weight)
3. First paragraph of full description
4. Throughout description (moderate weight)

**Density**: Use primary keyword 3-5 times naturally. Avoid stuffing.

## Cross-platform comparison

| Aspect | iOS | Android |
|--------|-----|---------|
| Keyword source | Dedicated field | Embedded in content |
| Description searchable | No | Yes |
| What's New length | 4000 chars | 500 chars |
| Promotional flexibility | Promotional text field | Short description updates |
| Formatting | Limited | Full formatting support |

## Localization requirements

Both platforms:
- Localize app name if it aids discovery (keep brand consistent).
- Localize description for each target market.
- Research keywords per locale (direct translation often suboptimal).

iOS:
- Separate keyword field per localization.
- 30-character limit applies to localized name.

Android:
- Embedded keywords must be localized in description.
- Short description especially important to localize.

## Update frequency guidelines

| Content | iOS Update | Android Update |
|---------|------------|----------------|
| App name | Requires review | Requires review |
| Subtitle / Short desc | Requires review | Anytime |
| Description | Requires review | Anytime |
| Promotional text | Anytime | N/A |
| Keywords | Requires review | N/A (embedded) |
| What's New | Per build submission | Per build submission |

## Character counting notes
- Character limits are Unicode characters, not bytes.
- Emojis count as 1-2 characters depending on platform.
- Line breaks count as characters.
- Test in platform preview before submission.
