## Example 2: Thought leadership (LinkedIn)

**Input:**
- Platform: LinkedIn
- Purpose: Establish expertise
- Topic: Why most product roadmaps fail
- Audience: Product managers

**Output:**
```
Most product roadmaps fail because they're not roadmaps—they're wishlists.

A real roadmap answers: What problem are we solving and why now?

I've seen teams spend months building features that:
→ Users didn't ask for
→ Didn't move business metrics
→ Created technical debt they're still paying off

The fix isn't better prioritization frameworks. It's asking harder questions before anything gets on the roadmap.

Three questions that save months of wasted work:

1. What evidence do we have that this matters?
2. What happens if we don't build this?
3. Who specifically will use this, and how do we know?

What's your process for keeping wishlists off the roadmap?

## Example 4: Engagement post (Twitter/X)

**Input:**
- Platform: Twitter/X
- Purpose: Drive engagement/discussion
- Topic: Controversial design opinion

```
Hot take: Most onboarding flows hurt more than they help.

They assume users want a tour. Users want to do the thing they came for.

What's the best onboarding you've experienced? What made it good?

## Example 5: Twitter/X thread

**Input:**
- Platform: Twitter/X
- Purpose: Educational content
- Topic: 5 pricing page mistakes

**Output:**
```
1/ Your pricing page is probably losing you customers.

5 mistakes I see constantly (and how to fix them):

2/ Mistake 1: Too many options.

Three tiers max. More than that creates decision paralysis.

If you have 5+ plans, you're not segmenting—you're confusing.

3/ Mistake 2: Features nobody understands.

"10GB of storage" means nothing to most buyers.

Translate features into outcomes: "Room for 50,000 documents."

4/ Mistake 3: Hiding the price.

"Contact sales" for pricing signals "expensive" and "complicated."

If you can show price, show price. Remove friction.

5/ Mistake 4: No social proof near the buy button.

Logos and testimonials should be visible when someone's deciding.

Trust reduces at the moment of commitment.

6/ Mistake 5: Burying the recommended plan.

Make your best-fit option obvious. "Most popular" badges work.

Don't make customers do math to figure out what they need.

7/ TL;DR:
- Max 3 tiers
- Outcomes, not features
- Show price
- Add social proof
- Highlight the right choice

What pricing page patterns have worked for you?
