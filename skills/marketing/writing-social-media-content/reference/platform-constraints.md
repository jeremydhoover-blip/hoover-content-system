## Character limits by platform

| Platform | Post Type | Character Limit | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------------|-------|
| Twitter/X | Standard post | 280 | Links consume ~23 characters |
| Twitter/X | Premium post | 25,000 | Available to Premium subscribers |
| LinkedIn | Post | 3,000 | Optimal: 700-1,300 characters |
| LinkedIn | Article | 125,000 | Long-form content |
| Instagram | Caption | 2,200 | First 125 visible before "more" |
| Instagram | Bio | 150 | |
| Facebook | Post | 63,206 | Optimal: 40-80 characters for engagement |
| Threads | Post | 500 | No hashtag functionality |
| TikTok | Caption | 2,200 | First 55-70 visible |

## Platform-specific formatting

### Twitter/X
- Line breaks render as-is
- Links auto-shorten to t.co (~23 characters)
- Images don't count against character limit
- Threads: Reply to your own tweets for series
- Hashtags: 1-3 max; more reduces engagement
- Polls: Up to 4 options, 25 characters each

### LinkedIn
- Line breaks create visual separation (use strategically)
- First ~140 characters visible before "see more"
- Rich formatting: Bold (**text**) and italic (*text*) via Unicode
- Document carousels: PDF uploads for swipeable content
- Hashtags: 3-5 recommended; place at end
- @mentions notify users; use sparingly

### Instagram
- Line breaks require workaround (use invisible characters or notes app)
- First 125 characters visible before "more"
- Hashtags: 5-15 recommended (30 max); can place in comment
- Alt text available for accessibility
- Reels captions: Shorter, hook-focused

### Facebook
- Links generate preview cards
- Optimal length varies by goal (short for engagement, long for thought leadership)
- Hashtags: Low utility; 1-2 max if any
- Native video prioritized by algorithm

### Threads
- No hashtags
- No link previews
- Conversational, casual tone expected
- Thread replies create conversation chains

## Hashtag guidelines

| Platform | Recommended Count | Placement |
|----------|------------------|-----------|
| Twitter/X | 1-3 | Inline or end |
| LinkedIn | 3-5 | End of post |
| Instagram | 5-15 | Caption end or first comment |
| Facebook | 0-2 | Inline if any |
| Threads | 0 | Not supported |

### Hashtag selection criteria
- Relevant to post content
- Active but not oversaturated
- Mix of branded, topic, and community tags
- Avoid banned or flagged hashtags (Instagram)

## Optimal posting patterns

| Platform | Best Length | Best Format |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Twitter/X | 71-100 chars | Hook + value + CTA |
| LinkedIn | 700-1,300 chars | Story + insight + question |
| Instagram | 138-150 chars visible | Hook + expand below fold |
| Facebook | 40-80 chars | Question or single insight |
| Threads | ~100-250 chars | Hot take or observation |

## Link handling

| Platform | Link Behavior | Recommendation |
|----------|---------------|----------------|
| Twitter/X | Shortened, counts ~23 chars | Include when driving traffic |
| LinkedIn | Preview card generated | Link in post, not comment |
| Instagram | Not clickable in caption | Direct to bio or use Stories |
| Facebook | Preview card generated | One link per post |
| Threads | Plain text, no preview | Links discouraged |

## Accessibility requirements

All platforms:
- Add alt text to images where supported
- Don't rely on emoji alone for meaning
- CamelCase hashtags for screen readers (#SocialMedia not #socialmedia)
- Avoid walls of emoji
- Video captions where supported

## Content policies (summary)

All platforms prohibit:
- Misleading claims
- Engagement bait that manipulates algorithm
- Competitor defamation
- Unverified health/financial claims
- Trademark misuse

Check platform-specific policies for:
- Political content restrictions
- Disclosure requirements (ads, sponsorships)
- Industry-specific rules (finance, healthcare)
