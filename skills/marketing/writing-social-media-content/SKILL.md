# Writing social media content

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Platform (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Threads)
- Post purpose (announcement, engagement, thought leadership, promotion)
- Key message or topic
- Target audience
- Any assets (images, links, videos)
- Brand voice guidelines

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify platform and extract constraints from [reference/platform-constraints.md](reference/platform-constraints.md).
2. Determine post type and goal (awareness, engagement, traffic, conversion).
3. Write hook (first line must earn attention).
4. Draft body within character limits.
5. Add CTA appropriate to platform and goal.
6. Include hashtags/mentions per platform norms.
7. Run character validation script.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Character limits, hashtag counts, and platform formatting are fixed.
- **Medium**: Tone, structure, hook style, and emoji usage.
- Allowed variation: Voice personality, hook approach, CTA phrasing—as long as rubric passes.
