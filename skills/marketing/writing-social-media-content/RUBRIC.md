# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Within platform character limit
- First line is a hook (earns attention, not filler)
- Core message is clear without clicking links
- CTA matches post goal (engagement gets question, traffic gets link)
- Tone matches brand voice and platform norms
- Hashtags are relevant and within platform conventions
- Links are functional and lead to expected destination
- No broken formatting (line breaks render correctly)

Fail if any are true:
- Exceeds character limit for platform
- Opens with weak phrasing ("We're excited to announce...", "Check out...")
- Buries the value below the fold (Instagram) or after click-through
- CTA is missing when post has a goal beyond awareness
- Hashtag stuffing (>5 on LinkedIn, >3 on Twitter, >30 on Instagram)
- Uses hashtags that are off-topic or excessively broad (#success #motivation)
- Tone mismatch (corporate speak on casual platform, casual on LinkedIn thought leadership)
- Thread doesn't have clear structure or payoff
- Contains unverified claims or promises
- @mentions people/brands without relevance
