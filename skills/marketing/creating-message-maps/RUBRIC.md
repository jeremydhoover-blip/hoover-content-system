# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Core message is a single sentence that conveys what, who, and why
- Core message can be understood in under 10 seconds
- Exactly 3-4 pillars (not 2, not 5+)
- Each pillar has a distinct theme (no overlap between pillars)
- Each pillar has at least one proof point (not just claims)
- Proof points are specific and verifiable (numbers, names, outcomes)
- Messages are benefit-focused (what users get, not what product does)
- Audience is defined with enough specificity to guide content decisions
- Hierarchy is clear: core → pillars → supporting → proof

Fail if any are true:
- Core message requires reading pillars to understand value
- Pillars overlap significantly in theme or claims
- Fewer than 3 or more than 4 pillars
- Proof points are vague ("customers love it", "industry-leading")
- Messages describe features instead of outcomes
- Multiple audiences without tailored messaging for each
- Competitive claims without evidence or counter-positioning
- Core message exceeds 30 words
- Uses jargon or acronyms without definition
