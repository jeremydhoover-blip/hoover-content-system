# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Single clear page goal identified
- Headline communicates primary benefit in ≤10 words
- Primary CTA is visible without scrolling (above the fold)
- CTA button text is action-oriented (verb first)
- Benefits are framed as outcomes, not features
- At least one form of social proof is present
- Page is scannable (headers, short paragraphs, bullet points)
- Objections are addressed before final CTA
- Secondary CTA reinforces primary goal (no competing goals)
- Supporting CTA text reduces friction

Fail if any are true:
- Multiple competing goals or CTAs (signup AND schedule demo AND download)
- Headline is a feature statement, not benefit
- CTA says only "Submit" or "Click here"
- No social proof anywhere on page
- Benefits section is a feature list without user outcomes
- Paragraphs exceed 3-4 sentences
- Page goal is unclear or missing
- Traffic source mismatch (ad promises X, page delivers Y)
