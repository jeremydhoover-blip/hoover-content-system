## Section purposes

### Above the fold
Everything visible without scrolling. Must accomplish:

| Element | Purpose | Priority |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Headline | Communicate primary benefit, match visitor intent | Critical |
| Subheadline | Explain what/how/for whom | Critical |
| Primary CTA | Capture motivated visitors immediately | Critical |
| Hero visual | Reinforce message, show product/outcome | High |
| Social proof snippet | Build instant credibility | High |

### Social proof section
Builds trust through third-party validation.

| Type | Best for | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| Customer quotes | Emotional connection | "This changed how we work..." |
| Logo bar | B2B credibility | Recognizable company logos |
| Statistics | Scale demonstration | "10,000+ teams" |
| Awards/certifications | Authority | "G2 Leader 2024" |
| Case study preview | Deep proof | "How X achieved Y" |

### Benefits section
Translates features into user outcomes.

**Structure per benefit**:
- Outcome-focused headline (what they get)
- 2-3 sentences explaining how
- Optional: supporting visual

**Rules**:
- 3-4 benefits maximum (more dilutes impact)
- Prioritize by audience importance
- Each benefit should be independently valuable

### How it works section
Reduces uncertainty by showing the process.

**When to include**:
- Process is unclear from product description
- Multi-step onboarding
- Technical audience who wants to understand

**When to skip**:
- Self-explanatory products
- Focus on outcome over process
- Short, high-intent pages

### Objection handling
Preemptively addresses concerns that block conversion.

**Common objections by type**:
| Product type | Common objections |
|--------------|-------------------|
| SaaS | Pricing, integration, migration, support |
| Enterprise | Security, compliance, scale, implementation time |
| Consumer | Trust, returns, quality, privacy |

### Final CTA section
Captures visitors who scrolled through everything.

- Reinforce the primary message
- Same CTA goal as above-the-fold
- Add urgency or address final hesitation

## Conversion principles

### The single goal principle
Every landing page should have one primary goal.

| Goal type | Appropriate for |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Email capture | Lead gen, gated content |
| Free trial signup | Self-serve SaaS |
| Demo request | Enterprise, high-touch sales |
| Purchase | E-commerce, low-consideration |
| Download | Apps, tools, resources |

**Anti-pattern**: Multiple equal-weight CTAs (Sign up OR Schedule demo OR Download)

### The message match principle
Page content must match traffic source expectations.

| Traffic source | Page must... |
|----------------|--------------|
| Search ad for "X" | Mention X prominently in headline |
| Social post about offer | Show offer above the fold |
| Email about feature | Lead with that feature |
| Branded search | Reinforce brand, show breadth |

### The specificity principle
Specific claims outperform vague ones.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "Fast setup" | "Set up in 5 minutes" |
| "Affordable" | "Starting at $9/month" |
| "Trusted by many" | "Trusted by 50,000+ teams" |
| "Easy to use" | "No code required" |

### The friction reduction principle
Every element between visitor and conversion is friction.

**Reduce friction by**:
- Minimizing form fields
- Adding trust signals near forms
- Setting expectations ("Takes 2 minutes")
- Removing navigation (keep focus)
- Answering objections before the CTA

## Traffic-source alignment

### Paid search visitors
- High intent, specific need
- Match ad copy in headline
- Get to the point fast
- Clear CTA above fold

### Social media visitors
- Lower intent, browsing mode
- Hook with outcome/benefit
- More social proof needed
- Longer engagement acceptable

### Email visitors
- Warm audience, some familiarity
- Can use product-specific language
- Reference the email context
- Higher conversion expectations

### Direct/organic visitors
- Mixed intent levels
- Need broader positioning
- More explanation acceptable
- Balance brand and conversion

## Common mistakes

### The feature dump
Listing every feature instead of focusing on key benefits.

**Problem**: Overwhelms visitor, dilutes message
**Fix**: Choose 3-4 benefits that matter most to target audience

### The CTA confusion
Multiple competing calls to action.

**Problem**: Decision paralysis, split tracking
**Fix**: One primary CTA repeated; secondary CTA only if same goal

### The wall of text
Dense paragraphs that discourage reading.

**Problem**: Page appears effortful, key points buried
**Fix**: Short paragraphs, bullet points, clear hierarchy

### The proof gap
No social proof or only weak social proof.

**Problem**: Claims feel unsubstantiated
**Fix**: Add quotes, logos, stats, or certifications

### The mismatch
Page content doesn't match what brought the visitor.

**Problem**: Immediate bounce, wasted ad spend
**Fix**: Mirror traffic source language in headline

### The hidden CTA
CTA buried below the fold or visually weak.

**Problem**: Motivated visitors can't find next step
**Fix**: CTA above fold, high contrast, clear button style
