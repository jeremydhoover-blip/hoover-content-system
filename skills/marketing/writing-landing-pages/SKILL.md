# Writing Landing Pages

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Page goal (signup, purchase, demo request, download)
- Target audience and traffic source
- Key value proposition and supporting benefits
- Available proof points and social proof

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define the single page goal and success metric
2. Identify the audience and their awareness level
3. Write headline that matches visitor intent
4. Build benefit-driven body sections
5. Create compelling CTA copy
6. Add proof points and trust signals
7. Address objections inline
8. Ensure mobile-first scannability
9. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Medium**: Structure follows conversion best practices; voice and specific messaging may vary
- Allowed variation: Section order based on awareness level; visual element suggestions

## Failure modes to avoid
- Multiple competing calls to action
- Feature lists without benefit framing
- Headlines that don't match traffic source expectations
- Wall-of-text that buries the CTA
