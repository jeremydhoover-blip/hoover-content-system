# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Single conversion goal per page or element (no competing CTAs)
- Headline communicates outcome or transformation (not feature or company name)
- CTA uses action verb specific to the offer (not "Submit" or "Click here")
- Primary objection addressed near the CTA (friction reducer present)
- Value is clear within 5 seconds of page load
- Social proof present and specific (not just "Trusted by thousands")
- Visual hierarchy guides eye to CTA
- Copy length matches audience awareness level
- Mobile-optimized (CTA visible without scrolling on mobile)

Fail if any are true:
- Multiple competing CTAs with equal visual weight
- Headline describes feature instead of benefit ("AI-powered analytics" vs. "Understand your data in minutes")
- CTA is generic ("Learn more", "Submit", "Click here")
- No friction reducers near conversion point
- Page requires scrolling to understand value proposition
- Social proof is vague or missing
- Dense paragraphs above the fold
- Form asks for unnecessary fields
- No clear next step for visitors not ready to convert (no secondary CTA)
