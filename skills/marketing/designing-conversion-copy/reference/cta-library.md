1. **Commitment level**: How much is the user giving up? (time, money, information)
2. **Awareness level**: How much do they already know about you?

## Testing guidance

### What to A/B test
1. Action verb (Start vs. Get vs. Try)
2. First person vs. second person (my vs. your)
3. With/without friction reducer
4. Button color and size
5. CTA placement on page

### Testing principles
- Test one element at a time
- Statistically significant sample size
- Measure actual conversions, not clicks
- Consider downstream impact (quality of leads, not just quantity)
