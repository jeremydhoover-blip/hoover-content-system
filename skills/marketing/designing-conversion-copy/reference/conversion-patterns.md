# Conversion patterns

## Core conversion principles

### 1. Single conversion goal
Every page or element should drive one primary action. Multiple competing CTAs reduce conversion.

**Apply**: Remove or visually de-emphasize secondary actions. If multiple paths exist, make one dominant.

### 2. Value before ask
Communicate what the user gets before asking them to act.

**Pattern**: Headline → Value → Social proof → CTA (not: Headline → CTA → Value)

### 3. Friction reduction
Identify and remove barriers to action at every step.

**Common friction points**:
- Required fields that aren't essential
- Missing trust signals near action points
- Uncertainty about what happens next
- Hidden costs or commitments

## Awareness-level frameworks

### Eugene Schwartz awareness levels

| Level | User state | Copy approach |
|-------|-----------|---------------|
| Unaware | Doesn't know they have a problem | Lead with pain, story, or curiosity |
| Problem-aware | Knows the problem, not solutions | Agitate problem, introduce solution category |
| Solution-aware | Knows solutions exist, not yours | Differentiate, prove superiority |
| Product-aware | Knows your product, undecided | Handle objections, add urgency |
| Most aware | Ready to buy | Direct CTA, offer, price |

### Copy length by awareness
- **Unaware → Problem-aware**: Long copy (educate first)
- **Solution-aware**: Medium copy (differentiate)
- **Product-aware → Most aware**: Short copy (just the CTA and offer)

## Headline patterns

### Outcome-focused
"[Achieve outcome] [without pain point]"
- "Build muscle without spending hours at the gym"
- "Manage projects without the chaos"

### Transformation
"[From current state] to [desired state]"
- "From spreadsheet chaos to dashboard clarity"
- "From inbox zero to inbox hero"

### Question
"[Question that triggers problem recognition]?"
- "Still manually tracking expenses?"
- "Know what's slowing down your website?"

### Proof-forward
"[Social proof element] + [claim]"
- "10,000 teams ship faster with [Product]"
- "The #1 rated [category] for [audience]"

### How-to
"How to [achieve outcome]"
- "How to double your email open rates"
- Use sparingly; can feel generic.

## CTA design patterns

### Anatomy of a high-converting CTA

```
[Action verb] + [Value/object]

[Friction reducer]
```

**Example**:
```
Start your free trial

No credit card required
```

### Visual hierarchy
1. CTA button has highest contrast on page
2. Supporting text directly below (not above) button
3. White space around CTA to draw focus
4. One primary CTA per viewport

### Button text principles
- Use first person when appropriate: "Start my trial" vs. "Start your trial"
- Action verb is specific to offer: "Get report" not "Download"
- Avoid anxiety-inducing words: "Buy now" → "Get started"

---

## Trust and proof patterns

### Social proof hierarchy (strongest to weakest)
1. Specific customer results with metrics
2. Named customer quotes with photo/title
3. Recognizable logos
4. Review aggregates (4.8/5 from X reviews)
5. User counts ("Join 10,000 teams")
6. Media mentions / "As seen in"
7. Generic testimonials

### Placement
- Near headline: Establishes credibility immediately
- After benefits: Proves claims just made
- Near CTA: Reduces final-moment doubt

### Trust signals
- Security badges (SSL, compliance certifications)
- Money-back guarantees
- "Cancel anytime" / "No commitment"
- Privacy statements
- Support availability

## Objection handling patterns

### Anticipate and address
Place objection handlers near conversion points where doubt peaks.

**Pattern**:
```
[CTA Button]

✓ No credit card required
✓ Cancel anytime
✓ Setup takes 2 minutes
```

### FAQ as objection handling
Structure FAQ to address buying objections, not just product questions.

**Objection-focused FAQ**:
- "What if it doesn't work for my use case?"
- "How long until I see results?"
- "What happens to my data if I cancel?"

### Risk reversal
Remove perceived risk to encourage action.

**Patterns**:
- Free trial (time-limited access)
- Money-back guarantee (financial risk)
- "No credit card required" (low commitment)
- "Cancel anytime" (no lock-in)

## Form optimization patterns

### Field reduction
Every additional field reduces conversion. Only ask what's essential for this step.

**Rule of thumb**: 
- Lead gen: Name + Email (2 fields)
- Signup: Email + Password (2 fields)
- Checkout: Minimum required for transaction

### Progressive profiling
Collect additional information over time, not upfront.

### Form UX patterns
- Inline validation (not just on submit)
- Clear error messages with fix instructions
- Logical field order (name → email → password)
- Mobile-optimized input types (email keyboard, number pad)

## Page-level patterns

### Above the fold
Users should understand:
1. What this is
2. Who it's for
3. What they should do

...without scrolling.

### Visual flow
Left-to-right, top-to-bottom reading pattern:
1. Logo (orientation)
2. Headline (value)
3. Subhead (detail)
4. CTA (action)
5. Social proof (trust)

### Scannable structure
- Headlines carry meaning independently
- Bullets over paragraphs
- Bold key phrases within text
- White space between sections
