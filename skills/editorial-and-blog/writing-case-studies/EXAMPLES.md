# Acme Corp cuts order processing time by 80% with OrderFlow

## At a Glance

| | |
|---|---|
| **Company** | Acme Corp |
| **Industry** | E-commerce |
| **Size** | 150 employees |
| **Use case** | Order processing automation |

### Key Results
- **80%** reduction in order processing time
- **Zero** manual entry errors since implementation
- **24-hour** faster average shipping time

---

## The Challenge

Acme Corp was growing fast—too fast for their manual processes to keep up. Their operations team spent 4 hours every day copying order data between systems: from their e-commerce platform to their inventory system to their shipping provider.

"We were drowning in copy-paste work," says Maria Chen, Operations Manager at Acme Corp. "Every order touched three systems, and every order was a chance for human error. We'd miss orders, ship to wrong addresses, double-ship. It was chaos."

The errors weren't just embarrassing—they were expensive. Acme estimated they spent $15,000 per month on shipping corrections and customer service recovery.

> "We knew we needed to automate, but everything we tried required custom development we couldn't afford."
> — Maria Chen, Operations Manager, Acme Corp

---

## The Solution

Acme implemented OrderFlow in January 2026. Within two weeks, they had automated their entire order pipeline—from e-commerce platform to inventory to shipping—without writing a single line of code.

### Implementation Highlights
- Connected Shopify, NetSuite, and ShipStation in one workflow
- Built automated validation rules to catch address issues before shipping
- Deployed exception handling for orders requiring human review

"The setup was surprisingly simple," Maria notes. "We mapped our workflow on Monday and were processing live orders by Wednesday."

---

## The Results

Six months in, the transformation is complete. What once took 4 hours now takes 45 minutes—and most of that is exception handling rather than routine processing.

### Quantified Impact

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Daily processing time | 4 hours | 45 minutes | 80% reduction |
| Manual entry errors | 12/month | 0/month | 100% reduction |
| Average ship time | 3 days | 2 days | 33% faster |
| Monthly error-related costs | $15,000 | $800 | 95% reduction |

> "OrderFlow paid for itself in the first month. Now my team focuses on customer experience instead of data entry."
> — Maria Chen, Operations Manager, Acme Corp

---

## What's Next

Acme is now expanding their use of OrderFlow to automate returns processing and inventory replenishment alerts. "We've seen what automation can do," says Maria. "We're never going back to manual."

## Example 2: One-page case study

**Input:**
- Customer: CloudFirst (tech startup)
- Problem: Security compliance taking too long
- Solution: Compliance automation platform
- Result: SOC 2 certification in 6 weeks

**Output:**
```md
# CloudFirst achieves SOC 2 certification in 6 weeks with ComplianceHub

**Industry**: SaaS | **Size**: 45 employees | **Use case**: Security compliance

## Challenge
CloudFirst was losing enterprise deals because they lacked SOC 2 certification. Manual compliance preparation was estimated at 6 months of work their small team couldn't spare.

## Solution
ComplianceHub automated evidence collection, policy generation, and audit preparation. CloudFirst connected their existing tools (AWS, GitHub, Okta) and let the platform continuously monitor compliance.

## Results
- **6 weeks** from kickoff to SOC 2 Type II certification
- **200+ hours** saved on manual evidence collection
- **3 enterprise deals** closed within 30 days of certification

> "Our auditor said it was the smoothest SOC 2 process they'd seen. ComplianceHub made us look like we had a dedicated compliance team."
> — Jordan Blake, CTO, CloudFirst

# How Greenlight Media transformed their creative workflow with [Product]

## The Transformation
