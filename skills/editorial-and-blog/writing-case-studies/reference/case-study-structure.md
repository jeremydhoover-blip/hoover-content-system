### Problem development questions
1. What specific task or process was broken?

## Results that resonate

### Metric hierarchy (strongest to weakest)

1. **Revenue/cost impact**: "$500K saved annually"
2. **Percentage improvements**: "80% faster processing"
3. **Time savings**: "10 hours/week saved per employee"
4. **Operational metrics**: "Zero errors since launch"
5. **Qualitative improvements**: "Happier customers"

### Presenting metrics effectively

**Before/After tables**
| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Processing time | 4 hours | 45 min | 80% reduction |

**Key results callout**
- **80%** reduction in processing time
- **Zero** errors since implementation
- **$50K** annual savings

### When metrics aren't available

If customer won't share specific numbers:
- Use directional language: "significantly reduced", "near-elimination"
- Focus on qualitative impact with specificity
- Use before/after descriptions
- Note that metrics are withheld at customer request

## Customer quote best practices

### Quote placement
- In problem section: Voice the pain
- In results section: Validate the outcome
- As headline: Powerful endorsement

### What makes a great quote
- Specific, not generic
- Emotional resonance
- Memorable phrasing
- Addresses prospect concern

### Weak vs. strong quotes

**Weak**: "We really like the product. It's been great."

**Strong**: "I used to spend the first hour of every day figuring out what feedback I'd missed. Now I open one dashboard and everything's there."

### Quote gathering tips
- Ask open-ended questions in interviews
- Listen for spontaneous enthusiasm
- Ask: "What would you tell someone considering this?"
- Get approval on specific quote text

## Anonymous case studies

### When to use
- Customer requests confidentiality
- Competitive sensitivity
- Regulatory constraints
- Pre-launch features

### How to handle
- Use descriptors: "A Fortune 500 retailer"
- Include enough detail for credibility
- Be transparent: "Customer name withheld at their request"
- Offer NDA conversation: "Contact us to discuss details"

### Making anonymous case studies credible
- Specific metrics (even without company name)
- Industry and size details
- Verified by third party (if possible)
- Detailed use case description
