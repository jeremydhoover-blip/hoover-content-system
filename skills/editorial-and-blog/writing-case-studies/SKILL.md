# Writing case studies

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Customer name and industry
- Problem they faced before your solution
- Solution implemented (your product/service)
- Results achieved (quantified where possible)
- Approval status (can we name them? quote them?)
- Target audience for the case study

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Gather raw materials (interview transcript, metrics, customer quotes).
2. Select structure from [reference/case-study-structure.md](reference/case-study-structure.md).
3. Identify the narrative arc: problem → solution → transformation.
4. Write compelling headline with result or transformation.
5. Draft each section, leading with specifics over generalities.
6. Pull and attribute quotes throughout (not just at end).
7. Quantify results wherever possible (time, money, percentage).
8. Add visual elements placeholders (screenshots, data charts).
9. Get customer approval on final draft.
10. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Must include quantified results and customer quote; must follow problem-solution-results arc.
- **Medium**: Structure format, quote placement, narrative voice.
- Allowed variation: Long vs. short format, single-page vs. multi-page—as long as rubric passes.
