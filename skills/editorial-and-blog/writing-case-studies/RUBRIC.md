Pass if all are true:
- Headline includes customer name and specific result or transformation
- At least one quantified result (number, percentage, time saved)
- Customer quote appears at least once (attributed with name and title)
- Problem-solution-results arc is clear and complete
- Problem section describes business impact, not just technical issue
- Results are attributed to your solution (causation is plausible)
- "At a glance" or summary section exists for quick scanning
- Customer has approved use of their name, quotes, and metrics
- CTA or next step is present

Fail if any are true:
- Headline is generic ("How [Customer] uses [Product]") without result
- No quantified metrics (vague "significant improvement" doesn't count)
- No customer quotes (or quotes without attribution)
- Problem is missing or underdeveloped (jumps straight to solution)
- Results are not clearly connected to the solution
- Claims are unverifiable or exaggerated
- Missing customer approval on any public-facing element
- Dense text without scannable elements (no headers, bullets, or summary)
- Competitor names mentioned without purpose
- Product features overshadow customer story
