# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Title clearly states the outcome, not just the topic
- Prerequisites are explicitly listed before steps begin
- Each step starts with an action verb
- Each step is atomic — accomplishes one thing
- Every step includes verification criteria (what reader should see/confirm)
- Code samples are complete and copy-paste ready (no pseudo-code in critical paths)
- Common failure points have inline troubleshooting
- Introduction states what reader will accomplish, not just what they'll learn "about"
- Reader can complete the tutorial without referring to external documentation
- Time estimate is included and realistic

Fail if any are true:
- Steps assume knowledge not listed in prerequisites
- Code samples have unexplained placeholders reader must figure out
- Steps say "configure as needed" without guidance on what configuration to choose
- Verification steps missing (reader can't tell if they succeeded)
- Errors or warnings that commonly appear are not addressed
- Tutorial works only on author's setup (unstated OS, version, or environment dependencies)
- Introduction is longer than the first step
- Steps combine multiple actions that could fail independently
- "See documentation for more details" used instead of providing essential information
- Outcome is vague ("learn about X") rather than concrete ("build a working X")
