# Writing Tutorial Articles

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Target skill or outcome the reader should achieve
- Reader's starting knowledge level
- Prerequisites (tools, accounts, prior knowledge)
- Estimated completion time
- Publication venue constraints

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Define the concrete outcome — what can the reader do or produce by the end?
2. Identify the reader's starting point and required prerequisites.
3. Break the task into discrete, testable steps.
4. For each step, determine what the reader should see or verify before moving on.
5. Identify common failure points and add troubleshooting inline.
6. Write the introduction last — summarize the journey, not the topic.
7. Add visual or code checkpoints where the reader can verify progress.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Accuracy of steps, prerequisite requirements, output verification
- **Medium freedom**: Level of explanation, number of examples, checkpoint frequency
- **High freedom**: Writing voice, analogies, opening hook

Default: Prioritize testable accuracy over engaging prose. A tutorial that doesn't work is a failed tutorial regardless of how well-written it is.
