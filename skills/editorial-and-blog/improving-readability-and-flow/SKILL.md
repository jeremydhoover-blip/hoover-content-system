# Improving Readability and Flow

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Current draft content
- Target audience reading level
- Channel constraints (web, mobile, print)
- Specific readability goals (if any, e.g., reading grade level)
- Content purpose (quick scan, deep read, reference)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Assess current state: sentence length distribution, paragraph density, structure.
2. Identify the intended reading pattern (scan, linear, reference).
3. Apply sentence-level improvements: length variation, active voice, front-loaded meaning.
4. Apply paragraph-level improvements: one idea per paragraph, transition quality, logical flow.
5. Apply structural improvements: subheadings, lists, visual breaks.
6. Check reading rhythm: vary sentence lengths, ensure natural pacing.
7. Remove friction: jargon, unnecessary complexity, passive constructions.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Factual accuracy, meaning preservation, terminology requirements
- **Medium freedom**: Sentence restructuring, paragraph breaks, transition wording
- **High freedom**: Structural reorganization, example selection, reading path design

Default: Improve readability without changing meaning. Flag any edits that alter substance.
