Pass if all are true:
- Average sentence length is between 12-22 words (or justified exception)
- No paragraph exceeds 6 sentences without structural reason
- Passive voice reduced to <20% (or justified for context)
- Each paragraph has a clear topic sentence or purpose
- Transitions between paragraphs create logical flow
- Sentence length varies (mix of short and medium sentences)
- Technical terms defined on first use or linked to definitions
- Lists used for 3+ parallel items instead of run-on sentences
- Front-loaded sentences (main point early, qualifications after)
- Visual breaks every 500-800 words for web content

Fail if any are true:
- Multiple consecutive sentences over 30 words
- Meaning changed without flagging
- Wall of text: 500+ words without subheading or break
- Monotonous rhythm: all sentences same length
- Missing transitions: ideas jump without connection
- Jargon introduced without definition for non-expert audience
- Excessive hedging ("might," "perhaps," "may potentially")
- Buried lede: key information after multiple introductory sentences
- Run-on paragraphs: more than one main idea per paragraph
- Readability degraded (metrics worse than original)
