# Structuring Long-Form Content

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Total content scope and key topics
- Target audience reading behavior (skim vs. deep read)
- Primary purpose (reference, narrative, instructional, persuasive)
- Platform constraints (web, PDF, print)
- Expected use pattern (read once, reference repeatedly)

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify the content's primary purpose and how readers will use it.
2. List all topics that must be covered — create a content inventory.
3. Group topics into logical sections based on reader mental model.
4. Sequence sections based on purpose: narrative (chronological), instructional (task order), reference (importance/frequency), persuasive (argument flow).
5. Establish heading hierarchy — no more than 3 levels for web, 4 for documents.
6. Add navigation aids: TOC, cross-references, summary sections.
7. Place scannable elements: callouts, pull quotes, key takeaways.
8. Verify each section can stand alone for readers who jump in.
9. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Logical topic grouping, heading consistency, navigation presence
- **Medium freedom**: Section sequence, level of summary/introduction text
- **High freedom**: Visual/structural elements, reading path design

Default: Optimize for scanning first, deep reading second. Most long-form content is not read linearly.
