Pass if all are true:
- Table of contents or navigation provided for content over 1500 words
- Heading hierarchy is consistent (no skipped levels)
- Each H2 section can be understood without reading previous sections
- Section length is balanced (no section more than 3x longer than average)
- Key takeaways or summary provided for content over 2000 words
- Parallel structure in same-level headings (all noun phrases or all verb phrases)
- Scannable elements present every 500-800 words (list, callout, subhead)
- Introduction states scope and audience
- Cross-references used when concepts span multiple sections
- Content grouped by reader mental model, not author's writing order

Fail if any are true:
- Wall of text with no subheadings for 1000+ words
- Heading hierarchy broken (H2 followed by H4)
- Critical information buried in the middle without navigation path
- Sections require sequential reading but content is positioned as reference
- Redundant information repeated across sections instead of cross-referenced
- Headings are vague ("More information," "Other considerations")
- Opening section over 300 words before first heading
- No indication of document length or scope
- Topics scattered across non-adjacent sections
- Visual structure doesn't match logical structure
