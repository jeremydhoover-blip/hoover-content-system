# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Contains a clear, defensible thesis that takes a position
- Thesis is distinct from obvious consensus — offers genuine perspective
- Opens with a hook that creates tension or curiosity (not a generic introduction)
- Claims are grounded in evidence: data, named examples, or documented experience
- Argument follows logical structure with clear progression
- Anticipates and addresses obvious counterarguments
- Author's voice is consistent and confident (minimal hedging)
- Ends with implication or call to reflection, not summary
- Author's expertise is relevant to the topic and made credible
- Audience's current beliefs are acknowledged before challenging them

Fail if any are true:
- Thesis is generic or could apply to any company/leader ("Innovation is important")
- Claims are unsubstantiated assertions presented as self-evident
- Opens with throat-clearing ("In today's rapidly changing world...")
- Excessive hedging ("might," "could potentially," "some may argue")
- Argument relies on strawman versions of opposing views
- Ends with "in conclusion" or restates the thesis verbatim
- Voice is generic corporate rather than individual author voice
- No clear "so what" — reader can't identify what to think or do differently
- All evidence is hypothetical or unnamed
- Lecture tone without acknowledging reader's context or intelligence
