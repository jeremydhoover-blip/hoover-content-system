# Writing Thought Leadership

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Author's area of expertise and credentials
- Core thesis or unique perspective
- Target audience and their current beliefs
- Supporting evidence (data, experience, case studies)
- Publication venue and format constraints

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify the author's distinctive point of view — what do they believe that others don't?
2. Define the audience's current mental model and where it needs to shift.
3. Establish the "tension" — the gap between conventional thinking and the author's insight.
4. Structure argument with opening hook, thesis, evidence, implications, and call to reflection.
5. Ground abstract claims in concrete examples, data, or named experiences.
6. Remove hedging language that undermines authority.
7. End with a forward-looking implication or provocation, not a summary.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Factual accuracy, attribution of claims, author credential representation
- **Medium freedom**: Argument structure, evidence selection, example specificity
- **High freedom**: Voice, rhetorical approach, opening hook style

Default: Match author's natural voice. Prioritize clarity of argument over stylistic flourish.
