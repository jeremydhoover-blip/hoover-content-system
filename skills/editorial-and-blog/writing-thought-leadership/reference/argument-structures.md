## Core structure: tension and resolution

Every thought leadership piece requires **tension** — a gap between what the audience currently believes and what you're arguing they should believe.

### The tension formula

```
Current belief + New evidence/frame = Updated belief
```

Without tension, you have an explainer. With tension, you have thought leadership.

### Tension test

Ask: "Would a smart person in my audience potentially disagree with my thesis before reading this?"
- **Yes** → Proceed
- **No** → Your thesis is too obvious; sharpen your point of view

## Argument patterns

### Pattern 1: Revelation
*"Something you believe is wrong, and here's why"*

```
1. State the conventional belief
2. Show evidence that contradicts it
3. Explain what the evidence means
4. Provide the updated frame
```

Best for: Counterintuitive insights, challenging industry orthodoxy

### Pattern 2: Synthesis
*"These separate trends add up to something bigger"*

```
1. Identify 2-3 independent trends
2. Show how they interact
3. Project the combined outcome
4. Explain what to do about it
```

Best for: Future predictions, strategic foresight

### Pattern 3: Reframe
*"You're solving the wrong problem"*

```
1. Describe the problem as commonly understood
2. Show why solutions aren't working
3. Redefine the actual problem
4. Explain how this changes the solution
```

Best for: Persistent challenges, shifting strategy

### Pattern 4: Permission
*"What you've been afraid to do is actually fine"*

```
1. Name the fear or constraint
2. Trace its origin (often outdated)
3. Show evidence it's no longer valid
4. Give explicit permission with guardrails
```

Best for: Breaking taboos, enabling action

### Pattern 5: Warning
*"Here's what's coming, and you're not ready"*

```
1. Describe current comfort
2. Identify the incoming disruption
3. Explain why current preparations are insufficient
4. Provide the real preparation needed
```

Best for: Change management, risk awareness

## Evidence hierarchy

Thought leadership requires grounded claims. Use the strongest evidence available:

| Strength | Evidence type | Example |
|----------|---------------|---------|
| Strongest | Named case study with metrics | "At Stripe, this reduced churn by 23%" |
| Strong | Aggregated data from credible source | "Gartner reports 67% of enterprises..." |
| Medium | Personal observation with specifics | "In my 12 years leading teams, I've seen this pattern in 8 of 11 companies" |
| Weak | Industry sentiment | "Everyone I talk to says..." |
| Weakest | Logical assertion | "It stands to reason that..." |

### Evidence rules

1. **Name names when possible** — "A Fortune 500 company" is weaker than "Microsoft"
2. **Be specific with numbers** — "About half" is weaker than "47%"
3. **Date your data** — Context changes; the year matters
4. **Acknowledge evidence limits** — "Based on my 40-company sample" is more credible than claiming universal truth

## Counterargument handling

Strong thought leadership anticipates objections. Weak thought leadership ignores them.

### The steelman approach

Present the opposing view at its strongest, not its weakest:

**Strawman (weak):** "Some people think testing doesn't matter at all."
**Steelman (strong):** "The case for comprehensive testing is well-established: it catches regressions, documents behavior, and enables refactoring. These benefits are real."

### Counterargument response patterns

| Pattern | When to use | Structure |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Concede and extend | Objection has merit | "This is true, and it's why [additional context that resolves it]" |
| Scope limitation | Objection applies to some cases | "For [specific case], you're right. This argument applies to [other cases]" |
| Evidence redirect | Objection is based on outdated info | "This was true until [event/data]. Now [new evidence]" |
| Reframe | Objection misses the point | "This objection assumes [X]. My argument is actually about [Y]" |

### Objections to address preemptively

For any thesis, identify:
1. The **obvious objection** — what a skeptical reader thinks in the first 30 seconds
2. The **expert objection** — what someone with deep domain knowledge would challenge
3. The **practical objection** — why this might not work in reality

Address at least the obvious objection explicitly in the piece.
