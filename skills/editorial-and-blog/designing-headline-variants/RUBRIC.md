# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- At least 4 distinct headline variants provided
- Each variant is clearly differentiated (different angle, not just rewording)
- All variants are factually accurate and supportable by content
- Character counts provided and accurate for each variant
- Platform constraints respected (length, format)
- At least one variant optimized for primary goal (CTR, SEO, engagement)
- Rationale provided for each variant's recommended use
- SEO variant includes target keyword if organic search is a goal
- Headlines stand alone — don't require context to understand
- No variant relies on clickbait that content can't deliver

Fail if any are true:
- Fewer than 4 variants provided
- Variants are synonymous (same idea, different words)
- Headline promises what content doesn't deliver
- Character count exceeds platform limits without acknowledgment
- All variants follow the same pattern (all questions, all how-tos)
- Missing recommendation for which to use when
- Headline requires seeing the image/context to make sense
- Uses prohibited clickbait patterns (shocking claim, bait-and-switch)
- No consideration of SEO when organic search is stated goal
- Variants don't match brand voice or style guidelines
