## Core headline structures

### Benefit-driven
Leads with the value the reader will get.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "How to [achieve outcome]" | "How to Write Emails People Actually Read" |
| "[Outcome] in [timeframe]" | "Better Sleep in 7 Days" |
| "The [adjective] way to [goal]" | "The Fastest Way to Learn SQL" |

**Use when:** Reader has a clear goal, benefit is compelling and deliverable.

### Curiosity-driven
Creates a knowledge gap the reader wants to close.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Why [unexpected thing]" | "Why Top Performers Take More Breaks" |
| "The [surprising] reason [outcome]" | "The Surprising Reason Meetings Fail" |
| "What [group] knows about [topic]" | "What Elite Athletes Know About Recovery" |

**Use when:** You have a genuine insight that contradicts expectations.

### Specific/Data-driven
Uses concrete numbers or details to establish credibility.

| "We [did X]. Here's what happened." | "We Deleted Slack for a Month. Here's What Happened." |
| "[Specific result] from [action]" | "23% More Conversions from One Button Change" |

**Use when:** You have real data, specificity is believable and relevant.

### Question-based
Directly addresses what the reader is wondering.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Should you [decision]?" | "Should You Learn Kubernetes in 2024?" |
| "What is [concept]?" | "What Is Zero Trust Security?" |
| "Is [thing] worth it?" | "Is an MBA Still Worth It?" |

**Use when:** Reader is at a decision point or learning something new.

### How-to/Instructional
Promises practical guidance.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "How to [action] without [negative]" | "How to Give Feedback Without Damaging Relationships" |
| "The complete guide to [topic]" | "The Complete Guide to TypeScript Generics" |
| "[Number] steps to [outcome]" | "5 Steps to Better Code Reviews" |

**Use when:** Content delivers actionable, step-by-step guidance.

### Emotional/Provocative
Evokes an emotional response.

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| "Stop [common mistake]" | "Stop Writing Meeting Agendas" |
| "You're [doing it wrong]" | "You're Measuring the Wrong Metrics" |
| "The [emotion] of [topic]" | "The Hidden Cost of Perfectionism" |

**Use when:** You have genuine insight that justifies strong framing; avoid if content can't deliver.

## Platform-specific constraints

### Web/Blog headlines

| Factor | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Length | 55-70 characters (Google truncates at ~60) |
| SEO | Include target keyword, preferably early |
| Readability | Clear on its own without image context |
| Front-loading | Most important words first |

### Email subject lines

| Factor | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Length | 30-50 characters (mobile preview ~35) |
| Spam triggers | Avoid: ALL CAPS, "free", excessive punctuation |
| Preview text | Subject + preheader work together |
| Personalization | [Name] or "you" can increase opens |

### Social media

| Platform | Length | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Twitter/X | 55-70 chars | Leave room for link, engagement |
| LinkedIn | 70-100 chars | Professional tone, benefit-focused |
| Facebook | 60-80 chars | Questions perform well |

### Push notifications

| Factor | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Length | 25-40 characters |
| Urgency | Justified urgency only |
| Clarity | No ambiguity — limited screen space |

## Patterns to avoid

### Clickbait red flags

| Pattern | Why it fails |
|---------|--------------|
| "You won't believe..." | Broken trust when content is mundane |
| "[Shocking/Amazing/Incredible]" | Hyperbole signals low quality |
| "This one trick..." | Associated with spam |
| Bait-and-switch | Headline promises what content doesn't deliver |
| Outrage bait | Damages brand trust |

### Vague headlines

| Weak | Why | Better |
|------|-----|--------|
| "An Important Update" | No information value | "Changes to Your Account Settings" |
| "Things to Know" | Too generic | "5 Security Settings to Review Today" |
| "A New Approach" | Says nothing | "How We Redesigned Our Pricing Model" |

### Overused patterns

Use sparingly or with fresh angles:

- "The Ultimate Guide to..."
- "Everything You Need to Know About..."
- "[Year] Ultimate [Topic] Guide"
- "Here's Why..." (without delivering substantive why)

## Testing and selection

### What to A/B test

| Variable | Test examples |
|----------|---------------|
| Length | Short vs. detailed |
| Format | Question vs. statement |
| Angle | Benefit vs. curiosity |
| Specificity | Numbers vs. general claims |
| Emotional tone | Neutral vs. provocative |

### Test one variable at a time
Don't test "How to Write Better Headlines" vs "7 Secrets to Headlines That Convert" — too many variables changed.

Better: "How to Write Better Headlines" vs "How to Write Headlines That Get 40% More Clicks" — tests specificity only.

### Selection criteria when not testing

| Priority | Consideration |
|----------|---------------|
| 1 | Does it accurately represent the content? |
| 2 | Does it meet platform constraints? |
| 3 | Does it serve the primary goal (SEO, CTR, shares)? |
| 4 | Is it differentiated from competitors? |
| 5 | Does it match brand voice? |
