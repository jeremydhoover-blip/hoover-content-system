Fail if any are true:
- Edits contradict the specified style guide without documented deviation

- Factual claims edited without verification or flagging
- Voice inconsistency introduced (e.g., switching from "you" to "users" mid-document)
- Silent deletions of substantive content
- Over-editing that removes author's legitimate stylistic choices
- Missing change log for substantive edits
- Introduces jargon, clichés, or filler not present in original
