# Editing and Style Enforcement

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Draft content to edit
- Target style guide (house style, AP, Chicago, or custom)
- Audience and formality level
- Publication channel constraints

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify the governing style guide and any documented deviations.
2. Read the full draft to understand intent and structure before making changes.
3. Apply structural edits first: heading consistency, paragraph breaks, logical flow.
4. Apply line edits: clarity, concision, voice alignment.
5. Apply copy edits: grammar, punctuation, spelling, capitalization per style guide.
6. Flag ambiguous or factually uncertain statements for author review.
7. Document all substantive changes with brief rationale.
8. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low freedom**: Style guide rules, grammar conventions, punctuation standards
- **Medium freedom**: Sentence restructuring for clarity, word choice within voice guidelines
- **High freedom**: Flagging content gaps, suggesting structural reorganization

Default: Apply all edits silently unless they change meaning. Flag meaning-altering suggestions as comments.
