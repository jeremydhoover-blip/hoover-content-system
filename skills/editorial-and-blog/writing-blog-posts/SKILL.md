# Writing blog posts

## Quick start
Collect or infer:
- Post type (thought leadership, tutorial, announcement, listicle, opinion)
- Target audience
- Primary keyword or topic
- Key takeaway or goal
- Desired length (short: 500-800, standard: 1000-1500, long: 2000+)
- Internal linking opportunities

Then produce output using [TEMPLATES.md](TEMPLATES.md). Validate with [RUBRIC.md](RUBRIC.md).

## Workflow
1. Identify post type and match structure from [reference/blog-structure.md](reference/blog-structure.md).
2. Research keyword and competitive posts for angle.
3. Write headline using proven patterns (and 2-3 variants).
4. Draft introduction with hook, context, and promise.
5. Structure body with scannable headers.
6. Write conclusion with key takeaway and CTA.
7. Add internal and external links per [reference/linking-policy.md](reference/linking-policy.md).
8. Run readability check with [scripts/readability_score.py](scripts/readability_score.py).
9. Run the rubric check. Revise until it passes.

## Degrees of freedom
- **Low**: Must have scannable structure, clear takeaway, and CTA.
- **Medium**: Tone, headline style, section ordering, example depth.
- Allowed variation: Voice, opening style, listicle vs. narrative—as long as rubric passes.
