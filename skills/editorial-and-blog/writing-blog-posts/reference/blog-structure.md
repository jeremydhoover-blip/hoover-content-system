## Introduction patterns

### The hook types

**Question hook**
> "What if everything you know about [topic] is wrong?"

**Story hook**
> "Last month, I watched a $10M deal fall apart over a single sentence in a contract."

**Statistic hook**
> "87% of [audience] say they struggle with [problem]. Here's why."

**Bold claim hook**
> "[Common practice] is dead. Here's what's replacing it."

**Relatable problem hook**
> "You've just spent 3 hours on a task that should take 20 minutes."

### Introduction structure (PAS)

1. **Problem**: What pain does the reader feel?
2. **Agitate**: Why is this urgent/important?
3. **Solution preview**: What will they learn here?

## Body structure patterns

### Linear progression
Section 1 → Section 2 → Section 3 (builds sequentially)

**Best for**: Tutorials, processes, narratives

### Modular sections
Section 1 | Section 2 | Section 3 (independent chunks)

**Best for**: Listicles, tip collections, reference posts

### Problem → Solution
Problems → Why they exist → Solutions → Implementation

**Best for**: Thought leadership, persuasive posts

### Before → After
Old way → Why it fails → New way → Results

**Best for**: Contrarian takes, product-led content

## Header hierarchy

### H1: Title
- One per post
- Clear, benefit-driven or curiosity-sparking
- Include primary keyword naturally

### H2: Major sections
- Scannable on their own
- Parallel structure (all actions, all questions, etc.)
- Should create outline when read in sequence

### H3: Subsections
- Use sparingly (only when H2 section needs subdivision)
- More specific than H2
- Not required for every post

### Header anti-patterns
- "Introduction" as a header (delete it)
- "Conclusion" as a header (rename to takeaway or action)
- Vague headers ("More thoughts", "Additional information")
- Questions as every header (overuse dilutes impact)

---

## Conclusion patterns

### Summary + CTA
> "Key takeaway: [one sentence summary]. Ready to try this? [CTA link]"

### Question for engagement
> "I'd love to hear your experience with [topic]. What's worked for you?"

### Teaser for related content
> "This is part 1 of our series on [topic]. Next week: [teaser]."

### Challenge
> "Pick one thing from this post and implement it this week. That's it."
