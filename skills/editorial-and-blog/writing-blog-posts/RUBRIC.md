# Rubric

Pass if all are true:
- Headline promises clear value or sparks curiosity
- Introduction hooks within first 2 sentences
- Main point/takeaway is identifiable within first 3 paragraphs
- Headers are scannable (reader can skim and understand structure)
- Each section delivers on its header's promise
- At least one internal link to related content
- External links are to authoritative sources (not competitors without purpose)
- Conclusion includes clear CTA (action, not just summary)
- Reading level appropriate for target audience (typically grade 8-10)
- Word count matches depth of topic (not padded, not superficial)

Fail if any are true:
- Headline is clickbait (promises more than content delivers)
- Opening is throat-clearing ("In today's world...", "Many people...")
- Buried lede (key point doesn't appear until late in post)
- Headers are vague ("More details", "Additional thoughts")
- Sections don't support the main thesis
- No internal links
- Links to low-quality or irrelevant sources
- Ends without direction for reader (no CTA)
- Dense paragraphs without visual breaks
- Obvious keyword stuffing that hurts readability
