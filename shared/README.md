# Shared Content Standards

## Scope

This folder contains global content rules that apply to all outputs produced using skills in this repo. These are constraints for content work, not for writing skill files.

## Purpose

- Define baseline content standards across all skill domains
- Ensure consistency when switching between skills
- Provide shared reference for RUBRIC.md grading criteria

## Files

| File | Governs |
|------|---------|
| `style.md` | Capitalization, punctuation, formatting, structure |
| `voice.md` | Voice attributes, tone boundaries, person and address |
| `accessibility.md` | Inclusive language, screen reader compatibility, cognitive load |
| `localization.md` | Translation-ready patterns, locale-neutral content |
| `legal-safety.md` | Regulated content, prohibited claims, required disclosures |

## How Skills Use Shared Standards

1. All content outputs must comply with shared standards.
2. Skills may add domain-specific constraints that extend shared rules.
3. Skills may not override or contradict shared rules.
4. Skill RUBRIC.md files reference shared files when grading (e.g., `[shared/style.md]`).

## What Belongs Here vs. in Skills
