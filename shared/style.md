# Style Standards

## Scope

Capitalization, punctuation, formatting, and structure rules for all content outputs.

## Hard Rules

### Capitalization

1. Sentence case for UI text, headings, labels, buttons.
2. Proper nouns retain standard capitalization.
3. Acronyms: all caps only if industry-standard (API, URL, SDK).
4. Product-specific terms follow `governance/glossary.json`.

### Punctuation

1. No terminal punctuation on:
   - Headings
   - Labels
   - Buttons
   - Incomplete sentence list items
2. Terminal punctuation required for:
   - Complete sentences in body copy
   - Complete sentence tooltips
   - Complete sentence error messages
3. Serial comma required in all lists.
4. En dash (–) for ranges. Em dash (—) for breaks. No surrounding spaces.
5. Straight quotes in code. Curly quotes in prose.

### Numbers

1. Spell out zero through nine.
2. Use numerals for 10 and above.
3. Always use numerals with units (5 MB, 3 users).
4. Percentages: numeral + symbol, no space (50%).

### Structure

1. List nesting: maximum 2 levels.
2. Heading nesting: maximum 3 levels.
3. List length: 2–7 items. Regroup if more.
4. Parallel structure required in lists and option sets.
5. One idea per sentence. Maximum 25 words.

### Formatting

1. Single space after periods.
2. No double spaces.
3. No trailing whitespace.
4. Bold for emphasis. Not italics. Not all caps.
5. Italics only for external work titles or defined term introductions.

## Prohibited Patterns

| Pattern | Issue | Alternative |
|---------|-------|-------------|
| `Click here` | Ambiguous link | Describe destination |
| `IMPORTANT:` | Caps for emphasis | `Important:` or restructure |
| `e.g.` / `i.e.` | Latin abbreviation | `for example` / `that is` |
| `he/she` | Binary assumption | `they` |
| `...` in UI | Incomplete thought | Complete the statement |
| Mixed spelling (`color`/`colour`) | Inconsistent locale | Pick one per glossary |

## Interaction with Skills

1. All outputs inherit these rules.
2. Skills may add formatting rules for their domain.
3. Skills may not override these rules.
